Although these principles can be used with car batteries or any other Lead Acid batteries This ebook does not consider them throughout. Take extra precaution when dealing with them. These batteries must be charged and discharged in a well ventilated area. Use goggles and acid gloves and aprons when handling these types of batteries. Danger Never connect a batterys negative terminal to another batteries positive terminal and then also connect the other 2 terminals. An explosion andor a fire could occur as a result. Never connect a battery in reverse pola rity to any instrument that was not designed to do so. Introduction I have tried to write this informational ebook in a way that anybody can understand.

I worked at N ASA and I worked for Texas Instruments. All as an electronic technician. During this time I went a step further and achieved certifications as a Biomedical Electronic Technician and an Industrial Electronic Technician. After 15 years in the industry, I reached the top of my pay grade and worked on starting my own business.

They usually have a lower charge current and therefore, take longer to charge a battery. However, most of these have no way to sense a full battery so that it can revert to a trickle charge. So what it does is continue to charge at the same rate when the battery is fully charged. This results in an overcharge condition and can seriously reduce the life of a battery and even damage the battery after an extended time on charger. This is typically evident in batteries whose users like to have the battery sitting on the charger all the time so that when they need it, it will always be fully charged. Unbeknownst to the user, he is slowly reducing the life of the battery and sometimes it doesnt take all that long. Sometimes weeks, sometimes months. A smart charger will make your batteries last longer mainly because it does not overcharge the battery.",

The term memory basically is described as the battery remembers its usual discharge point and superficially needs a charge whenever it hits that point. In other words, if you have a NiCd that always gets discharged to only 50 of its capacity, it will eventually not run belo w that 50 mark if you ever wanted to discharge it to a lower point. In a new NiCd battery the active cadmium is present in finely divided crystals. The memory effect develops as these crystals grow and reduce the effective surface area of the cadmium.

Pictures courtesy of Isidor Buchmanns  Batteries in a Portable World  This results in voltage depression which leads to a loss in capacity. Advanced crystal formation can lead to sharp edges piercing the separator between the plates and causing a high self discharge rate or an electrical short. Many people who do not know about this effect just throw away the battery because they think it is dead. More than likely, the battery can be revived providing that the battery isnt completely damaged (i.e. from years of memory buildup). Basically rejuvenation and reconditioning of the batteries can break down this crystal formation as long as they are not so ingrained from years of memory buildup. NiMh is also affected by this memory condition but not as pronounced. So these procedures can apply to them as well.",

I used a 1 foot section of speaker wire and attached to sets of color coded alligator clips obtained from Radio Shack. Caution : Use at least a 16 gauge wire - wire too thin can get very hot and even melt. 3) Color code the alligator clips so that you dont cross the wires. 4) Double check this by checking the co ntinuity of each color coded alligator clip.

Exercising the battery) This may sound dumb to you because it is so simple but you would be amazed at how many people dont know this. And it can revert a battery that has built up some memory. 1) Discharge your battery by running it through normal operation until it either shuts off or does not operate any longer. For example when your cell phone shuts off by itself or run your drill until it doesnt turn anymore. Note : On a power tool or a battery that is used in a high current application let the drill turn without a load (nothing to impede the turning of the chuck) when you are near the end of the discharge. 2) Then fully charge the battery.",

You can recondition the battery right after you just tested it because then it is discharged. 2) If you just tested the batterys capacity you can skip steps 3 thru 9 here. 3) Next you need a set of leads to connect the battery analyzer to the battery to be tested. I used a 1 foot section of speaker wire and attached to sets of color coded alligator clips obtained from Radio Shack. Caution : Use at least a 16 gauge wire - wire too thin can get very hot and even melt. 4) Color code the alligator clips so that you dont cross the wires. 5) Double check this by checking the co ntinuity of each color coded alligator clip. You will need to solder the wire to each alligator clip. However, you may be able to crimp them together. 6) Connect the Red Lead of the CBAII to the positive () terminal of the battery via the jumper wire.",

You can use many different batteries for the Resurrection process. I use a 12 volt power tool battery if possible. You could use a 6 volt lantern battery or a 12 volt car battery. 9) Now make sure that you positively note the negative (-) terminal and the positive () terminal of both batteries. 10) Touch negative (-) terminal to negative (-) terminal and positive () to positive () terminal for no more than 3 seconds. 11) New life is back in the cell. 12) Repeat this for each shorted cell. 13) Now check the shorted cell with the volt meter and you will see the short is gone and it is at full voltage.",

If you see a large spark - most likely you have the polarity wrong. 14) Reassemble the battery. Note : You will be amazed at how well a rejuvenated battery will work, but dont expect it to be as good as a brand new battery. Ni-Cad batteries have a life that dwindles each time it is charged. The cells in your battery are used and will eventually need to be rejuvenated again.

How to Revert a Reversed Cell No batteries are created equal, and what will most likely happen in a multi-cell battery is that one or more of the cells will reverse because they are weaker than the other cells. The reversed cell begins to accept a backwards charge from the other better charged cells around it. This is really bad for a battery if you dont catch it, because chances are it wont charge again while in the pack. If you are going to discharge a pack and you cannot open it to test individual cell voltages, please discharge to approximately 1.2 volts per cell.",

If you do reverse a cell and can access each individual cell, I have found that giving that cell about 4.5 volts (up to 1 A current) in the right direction, it will probably set itself straight. Measure the voltage of the cell after the shock charge. If it doesnt improve, try again. If you are still unsuccessful, try a higher voltage. Ive needed 9 volts in some cases to get a cell working again. Once you get the cell at  1.2 volts, immediately put the pack on charge now so that battery wont have time to reverse again.
