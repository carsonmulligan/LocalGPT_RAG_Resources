The term \"memory\" basically is described as the battery \"remembers\" its usual discharge point and superficially \"needs\" a charge whenever it hits that point.\n\nIn other words, if you have a NiCd that always gets discharged to only 50% of its capacity, it will eventually not run below that 50% mark if you ever wanted to discharge it to a lower point.\n\nIn a new NiCd battery the active cadmium is present in finely divided crystals.

Negative Electrode - The plate which has an electrical potential lower than that of the other plate during normal cell operation. Electric current from the external circuit flows into the cell at the negative electrode during discharge. Also called minus electrode. Self-Discharge - a decrease in battery capacity which occurs without any current flow to an external circuit.\n\nTypical values: 1% per day for NiCd 2% per day for NiMh ~0% per day for Lithium Ion and Lithium Polymer\n\nShort Circuit - Directly connecting the positive electrode (terminal) to the negative electrode (terminal) of the battery. Thermistor - A circuit element with a negative temperature coefficient.",
