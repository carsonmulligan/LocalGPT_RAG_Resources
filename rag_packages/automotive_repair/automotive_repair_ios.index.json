The vehicle is first raised with a jack and then placed on jack stands. (Do not go under the vehicle while it is elevated by a jack). The vehicle should be equally balanced on the jack stands.\n\nA mechanic(cid:1)s shop may have industry jacks or hydraulic lifts. These can be used to raise the vehicle and keep it elevated. These lifts can raise the entire vehicle at the same time. When lifting the entire vehicle the center of gravity should be positioned evenly with the lifting hoist arms. This is evident when the vehicle is raised and all tires lift off the ground at the same time. Most vehicles are front-heavy due to the engine block. However, many work trucks are balanced to have the center of gravity in the middle.\n\nHydraulic lift with hoist arms that raise the vehicle on its lifting points. The lift consists of two vertical blue beams and four white hoist arm",

It occurs in 4 repeating steps or cycles: \uf0b7 \uf0b7 Compression \uf0b7 Combustion (or power) \uf0b7 Exhaust\n\nIntake\n\nThe fuel and air are drawn into the engine cylinder by the piston moving down while the intake valve is open. When the piston starts moving up, both intake and exhaust valves are closed. The piston moving up compresses the air and fuel mixture. The air and fuel mixture is then ignited with a spark plug (in regular gasoline engines), creating combustion. The extreme heat creates high pressure forcing the piston down. Next, the exhaust valve opens. The piston goes back up exhausting",

A carburetor is a primitive method of mixing air and fuel. It is far less efficient than modern fuel injection. That(cid:1)s why all modern cars today are built with fuel injection.\n\nHow a Fuel Injection System Works:\n\nFuel injection is a complex electrical circuit using multiple sensors as inputs to a PCM (powertrain control module, also called the computer). The PCM then interprets the inputs from these sensors and produces a PWM (pulse width modulated) signal. A PWM signal is a digital on/off signal. This translates into how much fuel is injected into the engine.\n\nThe PCM then receives feedback signals from oxygen sensors. An oxygen sensor is a sensor that checks the air-fuel ratio by monitoring exhaust gas at or near the exhaust\n\n49\n\nCrawford(cid:1)s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair\n\nwww.CrawfordsAutoService.com\n\nmanifolds (review Chapter 5",

This means that as the input shaft goes around four times, the output shaft goes around one time. At 4,000 RPMs input you would have 1,000 RPMs output. Second gear may have a 3 to 1 ratio and third gear a 2 to 1 ratio. Fourth gear would be direct drive with a 1 to 1 ratio.\n\nThink of the sprockets on a bicycle.
