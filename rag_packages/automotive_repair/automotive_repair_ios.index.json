He couldnt feel touch or pain in that hand. He was working alone one night and his hand got caught in the fan belt while the engine was running. He was conscious long enough to get the engine to stop running with his other hand, but his right was stuck and he couldnt get out on his own. He eventually lost consciousness and lay there bleeding for three hours by himself. Bleeding this long could easily have resulted in death.",

Do not let pony tails down or leave any loose strands of hair. Bundle your hair up if its long. Do not w ear necklaces, rings or other jewelry. Some may remember Mr. T, the Mohawk-bearing muscle man from the 1980s sitcom The A-Team . He often wore about 50 lbs. of jewelry and frequently worked on motor vehicles.

Vehicles should always be on firm, level ground. If the ground is not level then the car may roll and tip the jack. A jack or a jack stand can also slip out or fail to hold the vehicle in an elevated position when the ground is not firm, such as on a dirt road or when there is ice or snow. There are different types of jacks and jack stands. A jack is used to raise the vehicle either by hydraulic pumping or hand cranking. A jack stand is used to keep the vehicle elevated and has a firm square base. One type of jack that people are most familiar with is the one that is included with the spare tire kit. This is to be used only for changing the tire and it is not sufficient for keeping a vehicle elevated when working under the vehicle. The jack used for changing tires often has a four point rectangular base.",

The vehicle is first raised with a jack and then placed on jack stands. (Do not go under the vehicle while it is elevated by a jack). The vehicle should be equally balanced on the jack stands. A mechanics shop may have industry jacks or hydraulic lifts. These can be used to raise the vehicle and keep it elevated. These lifts can raise the entire vehicle at the same time.

Keep a working fire extinguisher in an accessible place. All shop workers should know where the fire extinguisher is. An ABC or tri-class fire extinguisher is appropriate for auto repair shops. Also, have a plan for an emergency escape if a fire becomes uncontrollable. Keep an emergency response number posted clearly where everyone can see it. Keep a first aid kit handy for minor injuries, like superficial cuts and scratches.

Introduction to Tools Used by Mechanics: A commercial mechanics shop will usually have industry-standard tools, such as a torque wrench, hydraulic lifts, pneumatic (air-operated) tools, and electronic devices that connect with the vehicles computer to receive diagnostics. However, a startup repair shop or a highly proficient mechanic at home could get most jobs done with a 200 set of tools if needed. The most common tools in a mechanics set include the following: Flashlight. A flashlight is one of the most-used tools in an auto repair shop. It helps the mechanic see anywhere for visual inspections, maintenance and repairs. Flashlight Socket sets and wrenches. These have two different measurement systems.

Belts can also be checked by visual inspection and touch for signs of cracking, fraying, or glazing. Glazing means the drive surface of the belt will be shiny. Hoses can be checked visually and by touch for signs of cracking, swelling, or leaks. If the engine is cool, then squeeze the hose to check for softness. If there is any variation from hose to hose within the same vehicle then that could indicate a problem.",

There are three angle measurements that are used in tire alignment: camber, toe, and caster. Knowing these angles is necessary for any tire technician. In addition, knowing these angles can be helpful for anyone trying to communicate with tire technicians. In order to understand these angles one must consider the planes of the vehicle, which are ways of dividing the vehicle in each of its three dimensions (length, width and height). The horizontal plane, often depicted in math as the X plane, divides the vehicle into top and bottom parts. The vertical plane, often depicted in math as the Y plane, divides the vehicle into right and left parts (or drivers side and passenger side).",

It occurs in 4 repeating steps or cycles: Intake Compression Combustion (or power) Exhaust The fuel and air are drawn into the engine cylinder by the piston moving down while the intake valve is open. When the piston starts moving up, both intake and exhaust valves are closed. The piston moving up compresses the air and fuel mixture. The air and fuel mixture is then ignited with a spark plug (in regular gasoline engines), creating combustion. The extreme heat creates high pressure forcing the piston down. Next, the exhaust valve opens. The piston goes back up exhausting the exhaust gas. Then the cycle is repeated.",

How a Fuel Injection System Works: Fuel injection is a complex electrical circuit using multiple sensors as inputs to a PCM (powertrain control module, also called the computer). The PCM then interprets the inputs from these sensors and produces a PWM (pulse width modulated) signal. A PWM signal is a digital onoff signal. This translates into how much fuel is injected into the engine. The PCM then receives feedback signals from oxygen sensors.",

The transmission, which is where the actual gears are located, takes an input speed from the crankshaft and reduces it to the output speed until the vehicle is in direct drive. In other words, it changes the gear ratios. So, in first gear you might have an input to output ratio of 4 to 1. This means that as the input shaft goes around four times, the output shaft goes around one time. At 4,000 RPMs input you would have 1,000 RPMs output.

When you bring your vehicle to an auto repair shop and enter the office, youre usually greeted by a service writer. It doesnt matter if you go to a dealership, a franchised shop (like Midas or Firestone), or a small independent shop -- more often than not, the service writer is the first person you meet. The service writer acts as an intermediary between you and the repair technician. He tells the technician to inspect the car, the technician informs him what the findings are, and then he comes back to you with the findings. Some shops allow the customer to come into the repair room to see the technicians findings, but many dont.

They may say that your cooling system needs a flush when it doesnt or they could fudge the numbers on maintenance intervals to increase the frequency of services. Maintenance services are often based on mileage, so its easy for a shop to say that a service is required at 30,000 miles when it actually isnt due until 90,000 miles. By changing the interval to every 30,000 miles, they sell the service three times instead of one. This is why it is important to review the maintenance chart in the owners manual of the vehicle.

For example, this chapter may mention the art of negotiation, yet entire books have been written on the subject of negotiating, and increasing ones skill in negotiation will help the buyer to get a better deal. One of the most important things for potential car buyers to know is that the majority of vehicles depreciate in value over time. If you purchase a new or used vehicle from a dealership, the vehicle depreciates by about 20 of the sale price the minute it is driven off the lot. That means that if you turned around and sold the vehicle within a week, youd probably only be able to sell it for about 20 less than you paid for it. Its not like buying a house where the property generally increases in value over time (except during economic decline).",

Vehicles are not investments; theyre simply a necessary expense in locations that dont have good public transportation as an alternative. (They could be investments if you get involved in the collectors market, which is an entirely different game). It is also important to realize that the cost in owning a vehicle is much more than simply the sales price of the vehicle. All expenses must be considered before accepting the burden on your monthly budget. The sales price of the vehicle is just the beginning. If youre taking out a loan to pay for the vehicle then youll first have the monthly loan payment. Youll also have to pay for gas to run the vehicle. The price of gas varies from week to week and by location. Wednesday is probably the best day of the week to buy gas.

If they dont keep the vehicle beyond a certain time period, they dont have to pay interest on the loan, and they make the profit from the sale without an additional expense.",

If you happen to pick a vehicle that is near the end of its loan period, then the dealership might be willing to sell it at a cheaper price. December is a particularly good time since people are more willing to buy during the holidays and the dealerships want to increase their sales numbers before the end of the year.

After you agree on a price, the seller will take the title to the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or a private title shop and get the title notarized for selling the vehicle. You might use that time to go to the bank or a title loan store to get the money to pay for the vehicle. You can arrange for the best type of payment with the seller. If you pay for it in full from your bank account, then paying with a cashiers check made out to the seller may be more secure than carrying cash. Then you and the seller will meet up again to trade the payment for the title and keys. After you receive the title, youll have to take it to the DMV or to an independent title service shop to have a new title drawn up in your name and get your license plate. Within the next 10 days youll also need to call the insurance company to have the new vehicle added to your current coverage plan or purchase new insurance.",
