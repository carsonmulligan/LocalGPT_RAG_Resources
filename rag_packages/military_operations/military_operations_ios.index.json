Although useful at that time, much of the information has since become obsolete. Today, MWD teams are employ ed in dynamic ways never before imagined. Todays MWD team is a highly deployable capability that commanders have used around the world from Afghanistan to Africa and from the Balkans to Iraq. These specialized teams aid commanders in stability and support operations as well as in warfighting. Being m odular and mobile makes these teams very agile.

MWDs provide a valuable asset to military police, infantry, special forces, the Department of Defense (DOD), and other government agencies. The MW Ds senses of sight, smell, and hearing enhance his detection capabilities and provide commanders with a physical and psychological deterrent to criminal activity. Properly trained MWDs can prevent an intruder or suspect from escaping. When necessary, the MWD provides an added dimension of physical force as an alternative to the use of deadly force. Public knowledge of MWD team capabilities provides military police and various security forces with a formidable deterrent wherever the MWD team is employed. 1-2.",

These posts also usually enclose large areas, and it would take a large number of single se ntries to secure the area effectively.
