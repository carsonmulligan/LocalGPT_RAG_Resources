Ethical Anglers:  Are considerate of one another, respecting other anglers space and being quiet so as to not disturb others. Always leave their fishing area cleaner than when they arrived so as to protect the resource. Abide by all rules and regulations. Practice Catch  Release Fishing o Use barbless or circle hooks and needlenose pliers or forceps to reduce injury and handling time of the fish. o Land the fish as quickly as possible to minimize the fishs fighting time. o Use wet hands when handling a fish and minimize the time out of water to 20 to 30 seconds. o When returning a fish back to the water, point the fish into the current or cradle it in your hands loosely under the water until the fish swims away on its own.",

The depth of the bobber can differ depending on where and what fish species you are fishing for. Placing the bobber two feet from the end of your line is a good place to start after your hook and sinker or split-shot have been attached. The key to the bobber rig is to make sure after you cast, your line is tight so that fish biting at your bait will be noticeable.Another easy-to-use rig is a bottom or standard rig. For this rig, just tie on a hook,  attach some live bait and enough split shot to sink it to the bottom. Hold your line tight as you would if you were fishing a bobber rig, but be careful not to move it. Let the fish come to your bait. If you dont get a bite after 15 minutes, then reel in and cast again in a new spot. 6 A Beginners Guide to Fishing A Beginners Guide to Fishing 7 3.",

Fish External Anatomy  Senses  The lateral line is a special sensory organ that fish have in addition to the usual senses of seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling. The lateral line is a collection of nerve endings along a fishs side that feels vibrations in the water. It helps the fish determine the speed, direction of movement and even the size of the predator or prey thus helping them find food and avoid being eaten. The lateral line is very important to fish that live in deep water or in murky water. Fish eyesight is similar to ours. They see brightness and color; however, some species have better color vision than others. Fish that live in deep water dont see the full spectrum of colors since water filters out color.",

Finding Good Fishing Spots  The first thing you need to know about finding a good fishing spot is identifying all the things fish need to live. They need food, oxygen, water, shelter and space. Food will vary from fish to fish so know the particular foods the fish you are targeting likes. This will also help you determine the type of lure or bait to use.

Oxygen levels decrease with warmer temperatures, slow moving waters and lots of algae. And as you would guess, oxygen levels increase with colder temperatures, faster moving water, such as near riffles or waterfalls, and with less algae present. For shelter, fish need structures such as rocks, stumps and aquatic plants to provide cover to hide from predators or to hide and wait for food to swim by. Fish also need space. Too many fish using the same resources doesnt work out too well. Good fishing spots can be found near aquatic vegetation, brush piles, sand bottoms, rock and gravel bottoms, fallen trees, boat docks and stumps.

Sometimes a biting fish will cause the bobber to twitch only a bit or the bobber will start to move across the surface of the water. If you are not using a bobber, the best way to tell when a fish is biting is by watching your line between the rod tip and the water. If your line moves in a twitching or jumping motion, you are getting a bite. Sometimes the bite will be hard enough that you will feel its pull on the rod tip. When fishing without a bobber, you should set the hook or pull on the rod as soon as you feel that you are getting a bite. How To Set The Hook  When you see signs of a fish biting, move your rod tip from pointing towards the water to pointing straight out your belly button and wind up all slack line.

Then, slice down the backbone on one side of the dorsal fin and create another slice on the other side of the dorsal fin to connect the cut just made. Now, use pliers and pull the skin back from the body of the fish while holding the head with one hand. After removing the skin from the catfish, cut the head completely and remove the innards.

Filleting o ALWAYS CUT AWAY FROM YOURSELF! o Your first cut will be made behind the pectoral fin with the knife angled toward the top of the head, cutting only to the backbone (not all the way through the fish). o Next, cut along one side of the backbone with the knife scraping right above the rib bones without cutting them all the way to the tail. The knife should come out right at the base of the tail. o Lift the piece of meat from the bones. o Turn the fish over and repeat on the other side. o If desired, the skin can be removed from the fish by holding the tail with your fingertips and cutting between the flesh and skin with a sawing motion. Rinse the meat quickly in cold water and prepare for cooking. References Maas, Dave. Kids Gone Fishin . Minnesota: Creative Publishing International Inc., 2001. Maas, Dave, et al.",
