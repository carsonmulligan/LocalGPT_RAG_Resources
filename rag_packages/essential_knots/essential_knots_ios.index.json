The rabbit goes out of the hole around the tree and back into the hole. Sheet Bend (Stronger than a Square Knot, especially good for joining different size lines..) Make a loop in one end. The rabbit goes out of the hole around the tree back under his path. Slip Knot (Warning: This is a type of noose! This is a quick cinch knot.) Make a loop. Pull a loop up through the loop. Pull tight. Step-By-Step: Basic Scout Knots Page 2 Half Hitch Two Half Hitches (Taught-Line is much stronger.) Loop over the top (Half Hitch) Second Half Hitch on the outside. Pull tight.
