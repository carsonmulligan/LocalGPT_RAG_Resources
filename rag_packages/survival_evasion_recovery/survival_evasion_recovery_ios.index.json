A cut artery issuesbright red blood from the wound in distinct spurts or pulses that correspond to the rhythm of the heartbeat. Becausethe blood in the arteries is under high pressure, anindividual can lose a large volume of blood in a shortperiod when damage to an artery of significant size occurs.Therefore, arterial bleeding is the most serious type ofbleeding. If not controlled promptly, it can be fatal. Venous . Venous blood is blood that is returning to the heart through blood vessels call ed veins.

However, you can generally treat bites and stings as follows:  If antibiotics are available fo r your use, become familiar with them before deployment and use them. Predeployment immunizations can prevent most of the common diseases carried by mosquitoes and some carried by flies. The common fly-borne diseases are usually treatable with penicillins or erythromycin. Most tick-, flea-, louse-, and mite-borne diseases are treatable with tetracycline. Most antibiotics come in 250 milligram (mg) or 500 mg tablets. If you cannot remember the exact dose rate totreat a disease, 2 tablets, 4 times a day, for 10 to 14 dayswill usually kill any bacteria.

Bulbs are familiar to us as onions and, when sliced in half, will show concentric rings. Cloves are thos e bulblike structures that remind us of garlic and will separate into small pieces when broken apart. This characteristic separates wild onions from wild garlic. Taproots resemble carrots and may be single-rooted or branched, but usuallyonly one plant stalk arises from each root. Tubers are like potatoes and daylilies. You will find these st ructures either on strings or in clusters underneath the parent plants. Rhizomes are largecreeping rootstock or underground stems. Many plants arise from the eyes of these roots. Corms are similar to bulbs but are solid when cut rather than possessing ri ngs. A crown is the type of root structure found on plants such as asparagus. Crowns look much like a mophead under the soils surface.",

It is difficult to say how poisonous plants are because  Some plants require a large amount of contact before you notice any adverse reaction although others will cause death with only a small amount. Every plant will vary in the amount of toxins it contains due to different growing conditions and slight variations in subspecies. Every person has a different level of resistance to toxic substances. Some persons may be more sensitive to a particular plant. 10-3.",

You find scorpions ( Buthotus species) in deserts, jungles, and forests of tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate areas ofthe world. They are mostly nocturnal. Desert scorpions rangefrom below sea level in Death Valley to elevations as high as3,600 meters (12,000 feet) in the Andes. Typically brown or blackin moist areas, they may be yellow or light green in the desert.Their average size is about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). However,there are 20-centimeter (8-inch) giants in the jungles of CentralAmerica, New Guinea, and southern Africa. Fatalities fromscorpion stings are rare, but do occur with children, the elderly,and ill persons. Scorpions resemble small lobsters with raised,jointed tails bearing a stinger in the tip.

In a desert survival and evasion situation, it is unlikely that you will have a medic or medical supplies with you to treatheat injuries. Therefore, take extra care to avoid heat injuries.Rest during the day. Work during the cool evenings and nights.Use the buddy system to watch for heat injury. Observe the following guidelines:  Make sure you tell someone where you are going and when you will return. Watch for signs of heat injury. If someone complains of tiredness or wanders away from the group, he may be aheat casualty. Drink water at least once an hour. Get in the shade when resting; do not lie directly on the ground. Do not take off your shirt and work during the day. Check the color of your urine.",

Insects of almost every type abound in the desert. Man, as a source of water and food, attrac ts lice, mites, wasps, and flies. They are extremely unpleasant and may carry diseases. Oldbuildings, ruins, and caves are favorite habitats of spiders, scorpions, centipedes, lice, and mites. These areas provideprotection from the elements and also attract other wildlife.Therefore, take extra care when staying in these areas. Weargloves at all times in the desert.

Remember, cold weather is an adversary that can be as dangerous as an enemy soldier. Every time you venture into thecold, you are pitting yourself against the elements. With a little knowledge of the environment, proper plans, and appropriateequipment, you can overcome the elements. As you remove one or more of these factors, survival becomes increasingly difficult. Remember, winterweather is highly variable. Prepare yourself to adapt to blizzard conditions even during sunny and clear weather. Cold is a far greater threat to survival than it appears.",

Abundant fuels within the tree line are as follows:  Spruce trees are common in the interior regions. As a conifer, spruce makes a lot of smoke when burned in thespring and summer months. However, it burns almost smoke-free in late fall and winter. The tamarack tree is also a conifer. It is the only tree of the pine family that loses its needles in the fall. Without itsneedles, it looks like a de ad spruce, but it has many knobby buds and cones on its bare branches. Whenburning, tamarack wood makes a lot of smoke and is excellent for signaling purposes. Birch trees are deciduous and the wood burns hot and fast, as if soaked with oil or kerosene. Most birches grow nearstreams and lakes, but occasion ally you will find a few on higher ground and away from water.",

Take care not to snag the raft with shoes or sharp objects. Keep the repair kit where you can readily reach it. Rig a windbreak, spray shield, and canopy. Try to keep the floor of the raft dry. Cover it with canvas or cloth for insulation. Huddle with others to keep warm, moving enough to keep the blood circulating. Spread an extra tarpaulin, sail, or parachute over the group. Give extra rations, if available, to men suffering from exposure to cold. FM 3-05.70 16-1116-18.",

Do not fish when large sharks are in the area. Watch for schools of fish; try to move close to these schools. Fish at night using a light. The light attracts fish. In the daytime, shade attracts some fish. You may find them under your raft. Improvise a spear by tying a knife to an oar blade. This spear can help you catch larger fish, but you must getthem into the raft quickly or they will slip off the blade.Also, tie the knife very securely or you may lose it.

They may be shallow or deep, slow or fast moving,narrow or wide. Before you try to cross a river or stream, develop a good plan. 17-2. Your first step is to look for a high place from which you can get a good view of the river or stream. From this place, you canlook for a place to cross. If there is no high place, climb a tree.Good crossing locations include  A level stretch where it breaks into several channels. Two or three narrow channels are usually easier to cross than a wide river. A shallow bank or sandbar.",

It takes more time to construct than the brush raft or Australian poncho raft,but it is effective. To construct it, use one poncho, small saplings,willow or vines, and rope, bootlaces, or other binding material(Figure 17-6, page 17-9) as follows:  Make a framework circle by placing several stakes in the ground that roughly outline an inner and outer circle. FM 3-05.70 17-9 Using young saplings, willow, or vines, construct a donut ring within the circles of stakes. Wrap several pieces of cordage around the donut ring about 30 to 60 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) apart and tiethem securely. Push the ponchos hood to the inner side and tightly tie off the neck using the drawstring. Place the poncho on the ground, inner side up. Place the donut ring on the center of the poncho. Wrap the ponchoup and over the donut ring and tie off each grommet on the poncho to the ring.",

The plant grows from a large, thick, underground rootstock that is edible. Its large leaves resemble those of the banana plant but are not so large. The flowers of wild canna lily are usually small, relatively inconspicuous, and brightly colored reds, oranges, or yellows. Habitat and Distribution: As a wild plant, the canna lily is found in all tropical areas, especially in moist places along streams, springs, ditches, and themargins of woods. It may also be found in wet temperate, mountainous regions. It is easy to recognize because it is commonly cultivated in flower gardens in the United States. Edible Parts: The large and much-branched rootst ocks are full of edible starch. The younger parts may be finely chopped and then boiled or pulverized into a meal. Mix in the young shoots of palm cabbage for flavoring.",

Some species of snakes have specialized glands that contain a toxic venom, and long, hollowfangs to inject their venom. E-2. Although venomous snakes use their venom to secure food, they also use it for self-defense. Human accidents occur when youdont see or hear the snake, when you step on them, or when youwalk too close to them. E-3. Follow these simple rules to reduce the chance of accidental snakebite:  Dont sleep next to brush, tall grass, large boulders, or trees. They provide hiding places for snakes.

Other fish also fall in thiscategory, such as the barracuda, the moray eel, and the piranha. SHARKS F-2. Sharks are potentially the most dangerous fish that attack people. The obvious danger of sharks is that they are capable ofseriously maiming or killing you with their bite. Of the manyshark species, only a relative few are dangerous. Most cases of shark attacks on humans are by the white, tiger, hammerhead,and blue sharks. There are also records of attacks by ground, graynurse, and mako sharks.

Try fishing on the windward side or in deep passages leading from the open sea to the lagoon, but be careful ofcurrents and waves. Live coral reefs drop off sharply intodeep water and form a dividing line between the suspected fish of the shallows and the desirable deep-water species . Deepwater fish are usually not poisonous.

The EPA is a criticaldocument to an individual soldier or to a unit faced with evading enemy forces. First, it is a plan that will provide evaders a starting point to beginoperating effectively once evasion has begun. Second, it gives recovery forces the ability to know what the evaders are planning to do, thus makingrecovery operations easier. A well-thought-out EPA that everyone can understand is an important document to the evader.
