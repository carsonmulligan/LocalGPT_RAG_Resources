      "text": "Square Knot The square knot is used as a binding knot for such things as clamping a pad on a wound, tying a gathering rope on the male end of an extension cord, or as a shoestring knot. The bowknot we all use to tie our shoes with is really just a double slipped square knot. The books say not to use the square knot to tie two ropes together because it can untie itself under the right conditions but I have used a single slipped square knot to tie two ropes together for years without a problem yet.The Six Boy Scout Knots by John Geffre Clove Hitch The clove hitch is known in the oilfield around here as a claw hitch. It is the best knot to use with stiff large diameter rope because it never makes a sharp bend. It is also used to start and finish lashings. A lashing is a series of wraps tying two poles together.Bowline The bowline is used to make a non-slip loop on the end of a rope. It is called the king of knots and it is so dependable that it can be used for rescue work.",

It is used as an adjustable knot in tent guy lines and thats about all it is used for. This knot has to be internally tightened quite tight for it to work properly. Two half hitches works almost as well as this knot for tent guy lines and the truckers knot works even better.

In step 4 after you have pulled the bight (bight means rope folded in half) through the slip knot as tight as you can, pinch the crossing with your left thumb and forefinger so your right hand can tie the knot in step 5. The knot formed in step 5 is called a slippery half hitch or a slipped half hitch. By the way, a hitching tie is actually a slipped slip knot for anyone who cares about such things. If you tie the truckers knot using a hitching tie as shown, the whole conglomeration can be untied with only four pulls in the right places. See if you can figure out which are the four right places.Overhand Knot Use this knot on both ends of your rope to keep it from unraveling and as a stopper knot. I have found that I like a stopper knot better than whipping because both can come off the end of the rope but you can retie an overhand knot quickly and without having to find some whipping material.",
