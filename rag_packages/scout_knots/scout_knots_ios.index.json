The bowknot we all use to tie our shoes with is really just a double slipped square knot. The books say not to use the square knot to tie two ropes together because it can untie itself under the right conditions but I have used a single slipped square knot to tie two ropes together for years without a problem yet.\n\nBowline The bowline is used to make a non-slip loop on the end of a rope. It is called the king of knots and it is so dependable that it can be used for rescue work.\n\n1\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nAfter the bowline has been formed, you must tighten it correctly like this.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nTightened correctly Tightened incorrectly\n\nSheet Bend The sheet bend is the knot you are \u201csupposed\u201d to use to tie two ropes together.

You can tie on to a sheet or blanket with it if you fold the corner of the sheet into a point and substitute it for the left rope below.\n\nClove Hitch The clove hitch is known in the oilfield around here as a claw hitch. It is the best knot to use with stiff large diameter rope because it never makes a sharp bend. It is also used to start and finish lashings. A lashing is a series of wraps tying two poles together.\n\n1\n\nHere is how to tie it around a horizontal post.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nHere is how to tie it around a vertical post.\n\n2\n\nTwo Half Hitches Two half hitches is my favorite knot. You can tie onto almost anything with it.

If you go around the post two and a half times or more, you will make a knot called \u201cthe pipe hitch\u201d which will form a death grip on the post.\n\nTaut-line Hitch\n\nThe taut-line hitch is my least favorite of the six boy scout knots. It is used as an adjustable knot in tent guy lines and that\u2019s about all it is used for. This knot has to be internally tightened quite tight for it to work properly. Two half hitches works almost as well as this knot for tent guy lines and the trucker\u2019s knot works even better.\n\nThis end goes around a tent stake or a tree\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\nThis end comes from the tent\n\nOther Useful Knots\n\nOverhand Knot Use this knot on both ends of your rope to keep it from unraveling and as a \u201cstopper\u201d knot.

I have found that I like a stopper knot better than \u201cwhipping\u201d because both can come off the end of the rope but you can retie an overhand knot quickly and without having to find some whipping material.\n\nCoiling a Rope Learn how to do this, it is important.\n\nHitching Tie So cowboy, how do YOU tie your horse to the hitchin\u2019 rack? Learn how to tie this knot real fast and you can tie a rope to anything in about 3 seconds and untie it in nothing flat.\n\nThe Trucker\u2019s Knot This is the most useful knot that I know of. Use it to make a very tight rope between two objects. The knot in step 1 can be a clove hitch, two half hitches, or my favorite the hitching tie as shown. The knot in step 3 is called the slip knot.

The knot formed in step 5 is called a slippery half hitch or a slipped half hitch. By the way, a hitching tie is actually a slipped slip knot for anyone who cares about such things. If you tie the trucker\u2019s knot using a hitching tie as shown, the whole conglomeration can be untied with only four pulls in the right places.
