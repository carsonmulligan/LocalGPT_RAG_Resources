Wars are not won by machines and weapons but by the soldiers who use them. Even the best equipped army cannot win without motivated and well-trained soldiers. If the US Army is to win the next war, its soldiers must be motivated by inspired leadership, and they must know how to do their jobs and survive on the battlefield. This is the soldiers field manual. It tells the soldier how to perform the combat skills needed to survive on the battlefield. These are basic skills that must be learned by soldiers in all military occupational specialties (MOS). Users of this manual may submit recommended changes or comments, referring to the page and line(s) of the text. Reasons should be provided to insure understanding and complete evaluation.",

So you must be concealed from enemy observation and have cover from enemy fire. When the terrain does not provide natural cover and concealment, you must prepare your cover and use natural and man-made materials to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your position. This chapter provides guidance on the preparation and use of cover, concealment, and camouflage. CONTENTS GENERAL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",

Cover can also conceal you from enemy observa- tion. Cover can be natural or man-made. Natural cover includes such things as logs, trees, stumps, ravines, and hollows. Man- made cover includes such things as fighting positions, trenches, walls, rubble, and craters. Even the smallest depression or fold in the ground can give some cover. Look for and use every bit of cover the terrain offers. In combat, you need protection from enemy direct and indirect fire. To get this protection in the defense, build a fighting position (man-made cover) to add to the natural cover afforded by the terrain.",

Light discipline is controlling the use of lights at night by such things as not smoking in the open, not walking around with a flashlight on, and not using vehicle headlights. Noise discipline is taking action to deflect sounds generated by your unit (such as operating equipment) away from the enemy and, when possible, using methods to communicate that do not generate sounds (arm-and-hand signals).

REACTING TO INDIRECT FIRE If you come under indirect fire while moving, quickly look to your leader for orders. He will either tell you to run out of the impact area in a certain direction or will tell you to follow him. If you cannot see your leader, but can see other team members, follow them. If alone, or if you cannot see your leader or the other team members, run out of the area in a direction away from the incoming fire.",

FIRE AND MOVEMENT When a unit makes contact withthe the enemy, it normally starts firing at and moving toward the enemy. Sometimes the unit may move away from the enemy. That technique is called fire and movement. It is conducted either to close with and destroy the enemy, or to move away from the enemy so as to break contact with him. The firing and moving take place at the same time. There is a fire element and a move- ment element. These elements may be single soldiers, buddy teams, fire teams, or squads. Regardless of the size of the elements, the action is still fire and movement. The fire element covers the move of the movement element by firing at the enemy.

DAY OBSERVATION In daylight, use the visual search tech- nique tosearch terrain. Do this in two steps: Step 1. Make a quick, overall search of the entire sector for obvious tar- gets and unnatural colors, outlines, or movements. Look first at the area just in front of your position, and then quickly scan the entire area out to the maximum range you want to observe. If the sector is wide, divide it and search each subsector as in Step 2. 4-2 FM 21-75 Step 2. Observe overlapping, 50-meter- wide strips, alternating from left to right and right to left, until you have searched the entire sector. When you see a suspicious spot, search it well. NIGHT OBSERVATION At night, use anyone of three night obser- vation techniques to search terrain. Dark Adaptation Technique. First, let your eyes become adjusted to the darkness.",

For ranges up to 500 meters, count the number of 100-meter lengths between the two points you want to measure. Beyond 500 meters, pick a point halfway to the target, count the number of 100-meter lengths to the halfway point, and then double that number to get the range to the target. Sloping ground changes the appearance of l00-meter lengths. Ground that slopes upward makes them look longer than 100 meters, and ground that slopes downward makes them look shorter than 100 meters. Thus, the tendency is to underestimate 100-meter lengths on upslopes and overestimate them on downslopes. The accuracy of the 100-meter method depends on how much ground is visible. This is most true at long ranges.",

APPEARANCE-OF-OBJECTS METHOD (DAYTIME) This method is a way to estimate range by the apparent size and detail of an object. It is a common method that is used in everyday life. For example, a motorist trying to pass another car judges the distance of oncoming cars based on their apparent size. He is not interested in exact distances, but only in having enough room to safely pass the car in front of him. Suppose he knows that at a distance of 1 mile an oncoming car appears to be 1 inch wide and 2 inches high, with a half inch betweenthe headlights. Then, any time he sees an oncoming car that fits those dimensions, he knows it is about 1 mile away. The same technique can be used to esti- mate ranges on the battlefield.",

CHARACTERISTICS OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS The four main characteristics of nuclear explosions are: BLAST (an intense shock wave). THERMAL RADIATION (heat and light). NUCLEAR RADIATION (radioactive material). EMP (electrical power surge). 5-2 FM 21-75 Blast produces an intense shockwave and high winds that create flying debris. It may collapse shelters and some fighting positions. Thermal radiation causes burns and starts fires. The bright flash at the time of the ex- plosion can cause a temporary loss of vision or permanent eye damage if you look at the explosion, especially at night. Nuclear radiation can cause casualties and delay movements. It may last for days and cover large areas of terrain.",

It comes from the radio- active material originally in a nuclear weapon or from material, such as soil and equipment, made radioactive by the nuclear explosion. EMP is a massive surge of electrical power. It is created the instant a nuclear detonation occurs and is transmitted at the speed of light in all directions. It can damage solid-state components of electrical equipment (radios, radars, computers, vehicles) and weapon systems (TOW and Dragon).

EFFECTS ON SOLDIERS The exposure of the human body to nuclear radiation causes damage to the cells in all.parts of the body. This damage is the cause of radiation sickness. The severity of this sick- ness depends on the radiation dose received, the length of exposure, and the condition of the body at the time. The early symptoms of radia- tion sickness will usually appear 1 to 6 hours after exposure. Those symptoms may include headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Early symptoms may then be followed by a latent period in which the symptoms disappear. There is no first aid for you once you have been exposed to nuclear radiation. The only help is to get as comfortable as possible while under- going the early symptoms. If the radiation dose was small, the symp- toms, if any, will probably go away and not recur.",

Rubble from buildings being knocked down can bury supplies and equipment. Heat can ignite dry wood, fuel, tar- paulins, and other flammable material. Light can damage eyesight. Nuclear radiation can contaminate food and water. PROTECTION AGAINST NUCLEAR ATTACKS The best hasty protection against a nuclear attack is to take cover behind a hill or in a fight- ing position, culvert, or ditch. If caught in the open, drop flat on the ground at once and close your eyes. Cover exposed skin and keep your weapon under your body to avoid loss.

Interference in the form of static often occurs when you use radios near powerlines or electrical generators. Interference may also come from other radio stations, bad weather, or enemy jamming. Many of the things that may cause poor radio communications can be corrected by using common sense. Such things as making sure that you are not trying to communicate from under a steel bridge or near generators and power- lines, using the best available antenna for your needs, and selecting the best site for your radio help insure more reliable communications. You can also reduce the effects of enemy jamming by employing antijamming techniques. Radio is one of the least secure means of communicating.",

Panel markers are a series of cloth panels that you spread on the ground to communicate with aircraft.

Information is usually taken from those publications and placed in unit CEOIs and SOPs. Visual signals have some shortcomings that limit their use. For example, visual signals can be easily misunderstood. Some visual signals are restricted during poor visibility such as at night or in dense terrain. Of course, at other times, they can be intercepted by the enemy who may, in turn, use similar visual signals to create confusion.

Sound signals, like visual signals, can be easily misunderstood. WIRE COMMUNICATIONS Wire is another type of communications used in infantry units. Although installing a wire network takes more time than installing a radio, wire lines are usually more secure than radio. When you talk over wire lines, your voice travels through the wire lines from one tele- phone to another and is generally not sent through the air.",

It is important, therefore, to install wire lines properly to reduce the possibility of breakage. When laying wire lines, first consider the tactical situation.

Your leaders will often have you lay the wire and install and operate the field phones. WIRE-LAYING TECHNIQUES A surface line is field wire laid on the ground. Lay surface lines loosely with plenty of slack. Slack makes installation and main- tenance easier. Surface lines take less time and fewer soldiers to install. When feasible, dig small trenches for the wire to protect it from shell fragments of artillery or mortar rounds. Conceal wire routes crossing open areas from enemy observation.",

Place your fingers on his throat. Feel for the Adams apple. Slide the fingers down from the Adams apple to the side of the throat. This will place the fingertips over an artery, where the pulse can be felt. 8-6 FM 21-75 Restore Heartbeat.

C-4 FM 21-75 HOW TO BREACH AND CROSS WIRE OBSTACLES The enemy uses wire obstacles to separate infantry from tanks and to slow or stop in- fantry. His wire obstacles are similar to ours. To breach them, you should use wire cutters and bangalore torpedoes. Breaching a wire obstacle may require stealth; for example, when done by a patrol. It may not require stealth during an attack. Breaches requiring stealth are normally done with wire cutters.",

CUTTING THE WIRE To cut through a wire obstacle with stealth Cut only the lower strands and leave the top strand in place. That makes it less likely that the enemy will discover the gap.Cut the wire near a picket. To reduce the noise of a cut, have another soldier wrap cloth around the wire and hold the wire with both hands. Cut part of the way through the wire between the other soldiers hands and have him bend the wire back and forth until it breaks. If you are alone, wrap cloth around the wire near a picket, partially cut the wire, and then bend and break the wire.

When a foot displaces soft, moist soil to form a print, the moisture holds the edges of the print intact and sharp. As sunlight and air dry the edges of the print, small particles that were held in place by the moisture fall into the print, making the edges appear rounded. Study this process carefully to estimate the age of a print. If particles are just beginning to fall into a print, it is probably fresh. If the edges of the print are dried and crusty, the prints are probably at least an hour old. The effects of weather will vary with the terrain, so this information is furnished as a guide only.

INTERPRETATIONIMMEDIATE USE INTELLIGENCE When reporting, do not report your inter- pretations as facts. Report that you have seen E-8 FM 21-75 signs of certain things, not that those things actually exist. Report all information quickly. The term immediate use intelligence includes infor- mation of the enemy that can be put to use at once to gain surprise, to keep the enemy off balance, or to keep him from escaping an area. A commander has many sources of intelligence. He puts the information from those sources together to help determine where an enemy is, what he may be planning, and where he may be going.",

Some countertracking techniques are discussed in the following paragraphs: While moving from close terrain to open terrain, walk past a big tree (30 cm [12 in] in diameter or larger) toward the open area for three to five paces. Then walk backward to the for- ward side of the tree and make a 90-degree change of direction, passing the tree on its forward side. Step care- fully and leave as little sign as possible. If this is not the direction that you want to go, change direction again about 50 meters away using the same technique.

It prescribes the manner in which every soldier of the United States armed forces must conduct himself when captured or when faced with the possibility of capture. You should never surrender of your own free will. Likewise, a leader should never sur- render the soldiers under his command while they still have the means to resist. If captured, you must continue to resist in every way you can. Some rules to follow are: Make every effort to escape and to help others escape. Do not accept special favors from the enemy. Do not give your word not to escape. Do nothing that will harm a fellow prisoner. Give no information except name, rank, social security number, and date of birth.",

ESCAPE Escape is the action you take to get away FM 21-75 from the enemy if you are captured. The best time for you to escape is right after you are captured. You will probably be in your best physical condition at that time. Prison rations are usually barely enough to sustain life, cer- tainly not enough to build up a reserve of energy. The physical treatment, medical care, and rations of prison life quickly cause physical weakness, night blindness, and loss of coordina- tion and reasoning power. The following are other reasons for making an early escape: Friendly fire or air strikes may cause enough confusion and disorder to pro- tide a chance of escape.

If you get a hit, continue to fire, using the same sight picture, until the target is destroyed. If the first round is a miss, adjust the range and lead of succeeding rounds until you get a hit. Then continue to fire until the target is destroyed. Pair firing. In pair firing, you and another gunner prepare two or more LAWs each, and fire at a target one at a time. You swap infor- mation when firing at the target. The gunner seeing a target identifies it and gives the esti- mated range and lead he will use (for example, TANK, 150 METERS, FAST TARGET), then fires. If the first gunner misses, the second gunner quickly announces a revised estimate of range and lead (as appropriate) and fires.",

Some good places to put a pole charge H-5 161-017 0 - 94 - 8 FM 21-75 on a vehicle are under the turret, over the engine compartment, in the suspension system, and in the main gun tube (if the charge is made small enough to fit in the tube). Satchel charge. This is made of explosives (TNT or C4), nonelectric blasting caps, time fuse, detonating cord, tape, fuse igniters, and some type of satchel. The satchel can be an empty sandbag, or demolitions bag, or some other material. To construct a satchel charge, fill the satchel with the amount of explosives needed for the mission. Prime the explosives with two nonelectric firing systems. Use only about 6 inches of time fuse. Seal the satchel with string, rope, or tape, and leave the time fuse and fuse igniter hanging out of the satchel. Before throwing a satchel charge onto a target, fire the fuse igniters.",

In the defense, you prepare a range card for the squad automatic weapon, the M60 and caliber .50 machine guns, and the Dragon, TOW, 106-mm RCLR, 90-mm RCLR, and LAW anti- armor weapons systems. RANGE CARD DATA A range card depicts the following: Sectors of fire. A final protective line (FPL) or princi- pal direction of fire (PDF). Targets and ranges to them. Prominent terrain features. Weapons symbols. Marginal data. Range cards for antiarmor weapons use target reference points (TRP) instead of FPL and PDF.CONTENTS GENERAL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

FINAL PROTECTIVE LINE Where terrain allows, your leader assigns an FPL to your weapon. The FPL is a line on which you shoot grazing fire across your units front. The FPL will be assigned to you only if your leader determines there is a good distance of grazing fire. If there is, the FPL will then dictate the location of the primary sector. The FPL will become the primary sector limit (right or left) closest to friendly troops. When not firing at other targets, you will lay your gun on the FPL or PDF.",

I-9 FM 21-75 RANGE CARD FOR THE CALIBER .50 The only differences between an M60 and a caliber .50 range card are as follows: The machine gun symbol is different. There are 800 mils of traverse with the caliber .50 compared to 875 mils with the M60. Maximum grazing fire with the caliber .50 is 1,000 meters compared to 600 meters with the M60. The caliber .50 machine gun has a secondary sector of fire; but it must be marked by aiming stakes since the caliber .50 machine gun has no bipod. ANTIARMOR RANGE CARD The purpose of an antiarmor range card is to show a sketch of the terrain that a weapon has been assigned to cover by fire. Range cards for 90-mm RCLR, 106-mm RCLR, Dragon, and TOW are all prepared the same. By using a range card, you can quickly and accurately determine the information needed to engage targets in your assigned sector.",
