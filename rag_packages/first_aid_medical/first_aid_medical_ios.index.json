The Red Cross follows widely accepted guidelines for cleaning and decontaminating training manikins. If these guidelines are adhered to, the risk of any kind of disease transmission during training is extremely low.\n\nTo help minimize the risk of disease transmission, you should follow some basic health precautions and guidelines while participating in training. You should take precautions if you have a condition that would increase your risk or other participants\u2019 risk of exposure to infections.

This chapter discusses the causes of cardiac arrest and how to provide care for all age groups.\n\nCHAPTER 2 | Cardiac Emergencies and CPR\n\n29\n\nBACKGROUND The heart is a fascinating organ. It beats more than 3 billion times in an average lifetime. The heart is about the size of a \ufb01 st and lies between the lungs in the middle of the chest. It pumps blood throughout the body. The ribs, breastbone and spine protect it from injury. The heart is separated into right and left halves (Fig. 2-1).\n\nBlood that contains little or no oxygen enters the right side of the heart and is pumped to the lungs. The blood picks up oxygen in the lungs when you breathe. The oxygen-rich blood then goes to the left side of the heart and is pumped from the heart\u2019s blood vessels, called the arteries, to all other parts of the body. The heart and your body\u2019s vital organs need this constant su",

The heart and your body\u2019s vital organs need this constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n\nCardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that affects the heart and blood vessels. An estimated 80 million Americans suffer from some form of the disease. It remains the number one killer in the United States and is a major cause of disability. The most common conditions caused by cardiovascular disease include coronary heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease, and stroke, also called a brain attack.\n\nCoronary heart disease occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle harden and narrow. This process is called atherosclerosis. The damage occurs gradually, as cholesterol and fatty deposits called plaque build up on the inner artery walls (Fig. 2-2).

These contractions force blood out of the heart. The blood then circulates throughout the body. When the ventricles relax between contractions, blood \ufb02 ows back into the heart. The pause that you notice between heart beats when taking a person\u2019s pulse are the pauses between contractions.\n\nIf the heart is damaged by disease or injury, its electrical system can be disrupted. This can cause an abnormal heart rhythm that can stop the blood from circulating. The most common abnormal heart rhythm that causes sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the ventricles simply quiver, or \ufb01 brillate, without any organized rhythm. This condition is called ventricular \ufb01 brillation (V-\ufb01 b).

With V-tach, the electrical system tells the ventricles to contract too quickly. As a result, the heart cannot pump blood properly. As with V-\ufb01 b, during V-tach the person may collapse, become unconscious and stop breathing.\n\nIn many cases, V-\ufb01 b and V-tach can be corrected by an electrical shock delivered by an AED.

Breathing emergencies\n\nhappen when air cannot travel freely and easily into the lungs. Respiratory distress, respiratory arrest and choking are examples of breathing emergencies. In a breathing emergency, seconds count so you must react\n\nat once. This chapter discusses how to recognize and care for breathing emergencies.\n\nCHAPTER 4 | Breathing Emergencies\n\n55\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe human body needs a constant supply of oxygen to survive. When you breathe through your mouth and nose, air travels down your throat, through your windpipe and into your lungs. This pathway from the mouth and nose to the lungs is called the airway.\n\nAs you might imagine, the airway, mouth and nose are smaller in children and infants than they are in adults (Fig. 4-1, A\u2013B). As a result, they can be blocked more easily by small objects, blood, \ufb02 uids or swelling.\n\nIn a breathing emergency, air must reach the lu",

It occurs when the person\u2019s airway is partially or completely blocked. If a conscious person is choking, his or her airway has been blocked by a foreign object, such as a piece of food or a small toy; by swelling in the mouth or throat; or by \ufb02 uids, such as vomit or blood. With a partially blocked airway, the person usually can breathe with some trouble. A person with a partially blocked airway may be able to get enough air in and out of the lungs to cough or to make wheezing sounds. The person also may get enough air to speak. A person whose airway is completely blocked cannot cough, speak, cry or breathe at all.\n\nCauses of Choking in Adults Causes of choking in an adult include:\n\nCauses of Choking in Children and Infants Choking is a common cause of injury and death in children younger than 5 years.

Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. When someone suddenly loses consciousness and then reawakens, he or she may simply have fainted.\n\nFainting occurs when there is an insuf\ufb01 cient supply of blood to the brain for a short period of time. This condition results from a widening of the blood vessels in the body. This causes blood to drain away from the brain to the rest of the body.\n\nFainting usually is not harmful.

The seizure is a result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain and causes temporary, involuntary changes in body movement, function, sensation, awareness or behavior.\n\nEpilepsy Epilepsy is a chronic seizure condition. Almost 3 million Americans have some form of epilepsy. The seizures that occur with epilepsy usually can be controlled with medication.

Over 93 percent of these poisonings took place in the home. Fifty percent (1.2 million) involved children younger than 6 years. Poisoning deaths in children younger than 6 years represented about 2 percent of the total deaths from poisoning. The 20- to 59-year-old age group represented about 76 percent of all deaths from poisoning.\n\nIn recent years there has been a decrease in child poisonings. This is due partly to child-resistant packaging for medications. This packaging makes it harder for children to get into these substances. The decrease also is a result of preventive actions by parents and others who care for children. At the same time, there has been an increase in adult poisoning deaths. This increase is linked to an increase in both suicides and drug-related poisonings.\n\nTypes of Poisoning A person can be poisoned by swallowing poison, breathin",

An injury to the soft tissue commonly is called a wound. Any time the soft tissue is damaged or torn, the body is threatened. Injuries may damage the soft tissue at or near the skin\u2019s surface or deep in the body. Severe bleeding can occur at the skin\u2019s surface or beneath, where it is harder to detect. Germs can enter the body through the wound and cause infection.\n\nWounds usually are classi\ufb01 ed as either closed or open. In a closed wound, the skin\u2019s surface is not broken; therefore, tissue damage and any bleeding occur below the surface.

In most cases it usually stops by itself within a few minutes with minimal intervention. The trauma may cause a blood vessel to tear causing bleeding, but the blood at the wound site usually clots quickly and stops \ufb02 owing. Sometimes, however, the damaged blood vessel is too large or the pressure in the blood vessel is too great for the blood to clot, then bleeding can be life threatening. This can happen with both closed and open wounds.\n\nClosed Wounds The simplest closed wound is a bruise. A bruise develops when the body is bumped or hit, such as when you bump your leg on a table or chair (Fig. 7-2). The force of the blow to the body damages the soft tissue layers beneath the skin.

Abrasions do not bleed much. Any bleeding that occurs comes from capillaries (tiny blood vessels). Dirt and germs frequently have been rubbed into this type of wound, which is why it is important to clean and irrigate an abrasion thoroughly with soap and water to prevent infection.\n\nOther terms for an abrasion include a scrape, a rug burn, a road rash or a strawberry. Abrasions usually are painful because scraping of the outer skin layers exposes sensitive nerve endings.\n\nLacerations A laceration is a cut in the skin, which commonly is caused by a sharp object, such as a knife, scissors or broken glass (Fig. 7-5). A laceration also can occur when a blunt force splits the skin. Deep lacerations may cut layers of fat and muscle, damaging both nerves and blood vessels. Bleeding may be heavy or there may be none",

Ten of the pairs attach to the sternum (breastbone) in front and to the spine in back. Two pairs, the \ufb02 oating ribs, attach only to the spine. The rib cage, formed by the ribs, the sternum and the spine, protects vital organs, such as the heart, major blood vessels and the lungs. Also in the chest are the esophagus, trachea and muscles used for respiration.\n\nChest injuries are a leading cause of trauma deaths each year. Injuries to the chest may result from a wide variety of causes, such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports mishaps and crushing or penetrating forces. Chest injuries may involve the bones that form the chest cavity or the organs or other structures in the cavity itself.\n\nChest wounds may be either closed or open. A closed chest wound does not break the skin. Closed chest wounds generally are caused by blunt objects, such as steering wheel",

Bone injuries can bleed and usually are painful. If care is not given for the injury, the bleeding can become life threatening. Children have more \ufb02 exible bones than adults; their bones break less easily. But if a child sustains a fracture to a growth plate (areas of developing cartilage near the ends of long bones), it can affect future bone growth. Bones weaken with age.

People do not usually become aware they have this \u201csilent\u201d disease until after the age of 60 years.\n\nThe disease is caused by a decrease in calcium content of the bones. Normal bones are hard, dense tissues that endure great stresses. Calcium is a key to bone growth, development and repair. When the calcium content of bones decreases, bones become frail and less dense. They are less able to repair the normal damage they incur. This leaves bones, especially hip, back and wrist, more prone to fractures. These fractures may occur with only a little force. Some even occur without force. The person may be taking a walk or washing dishes when the fracture occurs.\n\nRisk Factors The risk of an American woman suffering a hip fracture alone is equal to her combined risk of breast, uterine and ovarian cancer.

Chest injuries range from a simple broken rib to serious life-threatening injuries.\n\nWhat to Look For Although painful, a simple broken rib rarely is life threatening. A person with a broken rib generally remains calm. However, a person with a broken rib will take small, shallow breaths because normal or deep breathing is uncomfortable or painful. The person usually will attempt to ease the pain by supporting the injured area with a hand or arm.\n\nIf the injury is serious, the person will have trouble breathing. The person\u2019s skin may appear \ufb02 ushed, pale or ashen and he or she may cough up blood. Remember that a person with a serious chest injury also may have a spinal injury.\n\nBroken ribs are less common in children because children\u2019s ribs are more \ufb02 exible and tend to bend rather than break.

A baby with colic also may clench his or her legs, feet and \ufb01 sts when crying.\n\nGiving Care Movement, including walking and driving in a car, may help. White noise, such as the sound of a vacuum in the next room or the clothes dryer, also may be helpful. You also can hold the baby using certain techniques to help relieve gas pain. Consult your health care provider to rule out more serious medical conditions.\n\nConjunctivitis Conjunctivitis is commonly known as \u201cpink eye",

Signals, found in one or both eyes, include redness, swelling, itchiness, a gritty feeling, tearing and a discharge that forms a crust during the night.

Medication is necessary when the cause of the infection is bacterial.\n\nDiarrhea and Vomiting Diarrhea, or loose stools, often accompanies an infection in children.
