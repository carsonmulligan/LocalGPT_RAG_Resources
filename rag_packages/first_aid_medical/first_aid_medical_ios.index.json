People are injured in situations like falls or motor-vehicle accidents, or they develop sudden illnesses, such as heart attack or stroke. The statistics are sobering. For example, about 900,000 people in the United States die each year from some form of heart disease. More than 300,000 of these deaths are caused by sudden cardiac arrest. Heart disease is the number one cause of death in this country. Another leading cause of death is unintentional injury.",

The EMS system is a network of community resources, including police, \ufb01 re and medical personneland you. The system begins when someone like you recognizes that an emergency exists and decides to take action, such as calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help. The EMS dispatcher or call taker answers the call and uses the information that you give to determine what help is needed (Fig. 1-1). Emergency personnel are dispatched to the scene based on the information given.",

Good Samaritan laws were developed to encourage people to help others in emergency situations.

Remember, some facilities, such as hotels, of\ufb01 ce and university buildings, and some stores, require you to dial a 9 or some other number to get an outside line before you dial 9-1-1.

While Giving Care To prevent disease transmission when giving care, follow what are known as standard precautions: Avoid contact with blood and other body \ufb02 uids  or objects that may be soiled with blood and other body \ufb02 uids. Use protective CPR breathing barriers. Use barriers, such as disposable gloves, between the  persons blood or body \ufb02 uids and yourself. Before putting on personal protective equipment  (PPE), such as disposable gloves, cover any of your own cuts, scrapes or sores with a bandage.",

When HIV infects the body, it damages the bodys immune system and impairs its ability to \ufb01 ght other infections. The virus can grow quietly for months or even years. People infected with HIV might not feel or look sick. Eventually, the weakened immune system allows certain types of infections to develop. This condition is known as AIDS.

After making the 9-1-1 call, immediately go back to the injured or ill person. Check the person for life-threatening conditions and give the necessary care (see Checking a Conscious and Unconscious Person section in this chapter). To do so, follow these general guidelines: Do no further harm. Monitor the persons breathing and consciousness. Help the person rest in the most comfortable position. Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. Reassure the person. Give any speci\ufb01 c care as needed. Transporting the Person Yourself In some cases, you may decide to take the injured or ill person to a medical facility yourself instead of waiting for EMS personnel.",

SHOCK When the body is healthy, three conditions are needed to keep the right amount of blood \ufb02 owing: The heart must be working well. An adequate amount of oxygen-rich blood must be  circulating in the body. The blood vessels must be intact and able to adjust  blood \ufb02 ow. Shock is a condition in which the circulatory system fails to deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the bodys tissues and vital organs. The bodys organs, such as the brain, heart and lungs, do not function properly without this blood supply. This triggers a series of responses that produce speci\ufb01 c signals known as shock. These responses are the bodys attempt to maintain adequate blood \ufb02 ow.When someone is injured or becomes suddenly ill, these normal body functions may be interrupted.

Helping the person to rest comfortably is important because pain can intensify the bodys stress and speed up the progression of shock. Control any external bleeding. Since you may not be sure of the persons condition,  leave him or her lying \ufb02 at. Help the person maintain normal body temperature  (Fig. 1-17). If the person is cool, try to cover him or her to avoid chilling. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink, even  though he or she is likely to be thirsty. The persons condition may be severe enough to require surgery, in which case it is better if the stomach is empty. Reassure the person.",

This barrier can help to protect you from contact with blood and other body \ufb02 uids, such as saliva, as you give rescue breaths. These devices also protect you from breathing the air that the person exhales. Some devices are small enough to \ufb01 t in your pocket or in the glove compartment of your car.

It beats more than 3 billion times in an average lifetime. The heart is about the size of a \ufb01 st and lies between the lungs in the middle of the chest. It pumps blood throughout the body. The ribs, breastbone and spine protect it from injury. The heart is separated into right and left halves (Fig. 2-1). Blood that contains little or no oxygen enters the right side of the heart and is pumped to the lungs. The blood picks up oxygen in the lungs when you breathe.",

The oxygen-rich blood then goes to the left side of the heart and is pumped from the hearts blood vessels, called the arteries, to all other parts of the body. The heart and your bodys vital organs need this constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. Cardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that affects the heart and blood vessels. An estimated 80 million Americans suffer from some form of the disease. It remains the number one killer in the United States and is a major cause of disability. The most common conditions caused by cardiovascular disease include coronary heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease, and stroke, also called a brain attack. Coronary heart disease occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle harden and narrow. This process is called atherosclerosis. The damage occurs gradually, as cholesterol and fatty deposits called plaque build up on the inner artery walls (Fig. 2-2).",

This reduces the amount of blood that can \ufb02 ow through them and prevents the heart from getting the blood and oxygen it needs. If the heart does not get blood containing oxygen, it will not work properly. Coronary heart disease accounts for about half of the greater than 800,000 adults who die each year from cardiovascular disease. When the heart is working normally, it beats evenly and easily, with a steady rhythm. When damage to the heart causes it to stop working effectively, a person can experience a heart attack or other damage to the heart muscle. A heart attack can cause the heart to beat in an irregular way. This may prevent blood from circulating effectively. When the heart does not work properly, normal breathing can be disrupted or stopped. A heart attack also can cause the heart to stop beating entirely. This condition is called cardiac arrest .",

Even people who have had a heart attack may not recognize the signals, because each heart attack may not show the same signals. You should be able to recognize the following signals of a heart attack so that you can give prompt and proper care: Chest pain, discomfort or pressure  . The most common signal is persistent pain, discomfort or pressure in the chest that lasts longer than 3 to 5 minutes or goes away and comes back. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to distinguish heart attack pain from the pain of indigestion, muscle spasms or other conditions. This often causes people to delay getting medical care. Brief, stabbing pain or pain that gets worse when you bend or breathe deeply usually is not caused by a heart problem.",

Do not use coated aspirin products or products meant for multiple uses such as for cold, fever and headache. You also may offer these doses of aspirin if the person regains consciousness while you are giving care and is able to take the aspirin by mouth. Be sure that you offer only aspirin and not Tylenol , acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02 ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, naproxen and Aleve.",

CARDIAC ARREST Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. The beats, or contractions, of the heart become ineffective if they are weak, irregular or uncoordinated, because at that point the blood no longer \ufb02 ows through the arteries to the rest of the body. When the heart stops beating properly, the body cannot survive. Breathing will soon stop, and the bodys organs will no longer receive the oxygen they need to function. Without oxygen, brain damage can begin in about 4 to 6 minutes, and the damage can become irreversible after about 10 minutes. A person in cardiac arrest is unconscious, not breathing and has no heartbeat.",

The heart has either stopped beating or is beating weakly and irregularly so that a pulse cannot be detected. Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of cardiac arrest in adults. Cardiac arrest also results from drowning, choking, drug abuse, severe injury, brain damage and electrocution. Causes of cardiac arrest in children and infants include airway and breathing problems, traumatic injury, a hard blow to the chest, congenital heart disease and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Cardiac arrest can happen suddenly, without any of the warning signs usually seen in a heart attack. This is known as sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death and accounts for more than 300,000 deaths annually in the United States. Sudden cardiac arrest is caused by abnormal, chaotic electrical activity of the heart (known as arrhythmias).",

CHAPTER 3  AED 45AEDCHAPTER 3 Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating normally because of abnormal electrical activity of the heart. Every year in the United States more than 300,000 people die of sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone, anytime without warning but usually occurs in adults. Most cardiac arrests happen in the home. Therefore, knowing how to activate the emergency medical services (EMS) system, perform CPR and use an automated external de\ufb01 brillator (AED) could help you save a lifemost likely someone you love.",

These signals travel through the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria , to the lower chambers, called the ventricles. When the heart is normal and healthy, these electrical signals cause the ventricles to squeeze together, or contract. These contractions force blood out of the heart. The blood then circulates throughout the body. When the ventricles relax between contractions, blood \ufb02 ows back into the heart.",

The pause that you notice between heart beats when taking a persons pulse are the pauses between contractions. If the heart is damaged by disease or injury, its electrical system can be disrupted. This can cause an abnormal heart rhythm that can stop the blood from circulating. The most common abnormal heart rhythm that causes sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the ventricles simply quiver, or \ufb01 brillate, without any organized rhythm. This condition is called ventricular \ufb01 brillation (V-\ufb01 b). In V-\ufb01 b, the electrical impulses \ufb01 re at random, creating chaos and preventing the heart from pumping and circulating blood. The person may suddenly collapse unconscious, and stop breathing. Another abnormal rhythm found during sudden cardiac arrest is ventricular tachycardia, or V-tach. With V-tach, the electrical system tells the ventricles to contract too quickly. As a result, the heart cannot pump blood properly.",

In many cases, V-\ufb01 b and V-tach can be corrected by an electrical shock delivered by an AED. AEDs are portable electronic devices that analyze the hearts rhythm and deliver an electrical shock, known as de\ufb01 brillation, which helps the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm (Fig. 3-1). For each minute that CPR and de\ufb01 brillation are delayed, the persons chance for survival is reduced by about 10 percent. However, by learning how to perform CPR and use an AED, you can make a difference before EMS personnel take over. USING AN AED When a cardiac arrest in an adult occurs, call 9-1-1 or local emergency number and begin CPR immediately. Also, use an AED as soon as it is available and ready to use (Fig. 3-2).

As you might imagine, the airway, mouth and nose are smaller in children and infants than they are in adults (Fig. 4-1, AB). As a result, they can be blocked more easily by small objects, blood, \ufb02 uids or swelling. In a breathing emergency, air must reach the lungs. For any person, regardless of age, it is important to keep the airway open when giving care. Once air reaches the lungs, oxygen in the air is transferred to the blood. The heart pumps the blood throughout the body. The blood \ufb02 ows through the blood vessels, delivering oxygen to the brain, heart and all other parts of the body. In some breathing emergencies the oxygen supply to the body is greatly reduced, whereas in others the oxygen supply is cut off entirely. As a result, the heart soon stops beating and blood no longer moves through the body. Without oxygen, brain cells can begin to die within 4 to 6 minutes (Fig. 4-2).",

It is important to recognize breathing emergencies in children and infants and act before the heart stops beating. Frequently, an adults heart stops working (known as cardiac arrest ) because of heart disease. However, children and infants usually have healthy hearts. When the heart stops in a child or infant, it usually is the result of a breathing emergency. No matter what the age of the person, trouble breathing can be the \ufb01 rst signal of a more serious emergency, such as a heart problem.

Asthma is the third-ranking cause of hospitalization among those younger than 15 years. You often can tell when a person is having an asthma attack by the hoarse whistling sound that he or she makes while exhaling. This sound, known as wheezing, occurs because air becomes trapped in the lungs. Trouble breathing, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest and coughing after exercise are other signals of an asthma attack. Usually, people diagnosed with asthma prevent and control their attacks with medication. These medications reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. They also relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways, making breathing easier. For more information on asthma, see Chapter 10.",

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung disease encompassing both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD causes a person to have trouble breathing because of damage to the lungs. In a person with COPD, the airways become partly blocked and the air sacs in the lungs lose their ability to \ufb01 ll with air. This makes it hard to breathe in and out. There is no cure for COPD, and it worsens over time. The most common cause of COPD is cigarette smoking, but breathing in other types of lung irritants, pollution, dust or chemicals over a long period also can cause COPD. It usually is diagnosed when a person is middle aged or older. It is the fourth-ranking cause of death in the United States and a major cause of illness. Common signals of COPD include: Coughing up a large volume of mucus. Tendency to tire easily. Loss of appetite.",

Walking, playing or running with food or objects in the mouth.Causes of Choking in Children and Infants Choking is a common cause of injury and death in children younger than 5 years. Because young children put nearly everything in their mouths, small, nonfood items, such as safety pins, small parts from toys and coins, often cause choking. However, food is responsible for most of the choking incidents in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that young children not be given hard, smooth foods such as raw vegetables. These foods must be chewed with a grinding motion, which is a skill that children do not master until 4 years of age; therefore, children may attempt to swallow these foods whole. For this same reason, the AAP recommends not giving children peanuts until they are 7 years of age or older.",

Fainting One common signal of sudden illness is a loss of consciousness, such as when a person faints. Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. When someone suddenly loses consciousness and then reawakens, he or she may simply have fainted. Fainting occurs when there is an insuf\ufb01 cient supply of blood to the brain for a short period of time. This condition results from a widening of the blood vessels in the body. This causes blood to drain away from the brain to the rest of the body. Fainting usually is not harmful. The person usually recovers quickly with no lasting effects. However, what appears to be a simple case of fainting actually may be a signal of a more serious condition. What to Look For A person who is about to faint often becomes pale, begins to sweat and then loses consciousness and collapses.",

Still, some people with epilepsy who take seizure medication occasionally have seizures. Others who go a long time without a seizure may think that the condition has gone away and stop taking their medication, thus putting themselves at risk for another seizure.

CHAPTER 5  Sudden Illness 71Febrile Seizures Young children and infants may be at risk for febrile seizures, which are seizures brought on by a rapid increase in body temperature. They are most common in children younger than 5 years. Febrile seizures often are caused by infections of the ear, throat or digestive system and are most likely to occur when a child or an infant experiences a rapid rise in temperature. A child or an infant experiencing a febrile seizure may experience some or all of the signals listed below. What to Look For Signals of seizures include: A blank stare. A period of distorted sensation during which the person is unable to respond. Uncontrolled muscular contractions, called convulsions , which last several minutes. A person with epilepsy may experience something called an aura before the seizure occurs.",

Nearly 800,000 Americans will have a stroke this year. A stroke, also called a brain attack, is caused when blood \ufb02 ow to a part of the brain is cut off or when there is bleeding into the brain. Strokes can cause permanent brain damage, but sometimes the damage can be stopped or reversed. A stroke usually is caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the brain. Once the blood \ufb02 ow is cut off, that part of the brain starts to suffocate and die unless the blood \ufb02 ow can be restored. Blockages can be caused by blood clots that travel from other parts of the body, like the heart, or they can be caused by slow damage to the arteries over time from diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes. In a small percentage of strokes there is bleeding into the brain.",

High Blood Pressure Uncontrolled high blood pressure is the number one risk factor for stroke. If you have high blood pressure, you are approximately seven times more likely to have a stroke compared with someone who does not have high blood pressure.

This process is regulated by insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas. Diabetes can lead to other medical conditions such as blindness, nerve disease, kidney disease, heart disease and stroke. The cells in your body need glucose (sugar) as a source of energy. The cells receive this energy during digestion or from stored forms of sugar. The sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream with the help of insulin. Insulin is produced in the pancreas. For the body to properly function, there has to be a balance of insulin and sugar. People who have diabetes may become suddenly ill because there is too much or too little sugar in their blood. There are two major types of diabetes: Type I and Type II diabetes. Type I diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, affects about 1 million Americans.",

The exact cause of Type I diabetes is not known. Warning signals include: Frequent urination. Increased hunger and thirst. Unexpected weight loss. Irritability. Weakness and fatigue. Type II diabetes is the most common type, affecting about 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes. This condition usually occurs in adults but also can occur in children. With Type II diabetes, the body makes insulin but not enough to meet the bodys needs or the body becomes resistant to the insulin produced.

Over 93 percent of these poisonings took place in the home. Fifty percent (1.2 million) involved children younger than 6 years. Poisoning deaths in children younger than 6 years represented about 2 percent of the total deaths from poisoning. The 20- to 59-year-old age group represented about 76 percent of all deaths from poisoning. In recent years there has been a decrease in child poisonings. This is due partly to child-resistant packaging for medications. This packaging makes it harder for children to get into these substances. The decrease also is a result of preventive actions by parents and others who care for children. At the same time, there has been an increase in adult poisoning deaths. This increase is linked to an increase in both suicides and drug-related poisonings.",

Follow these guidelines to guard against poisoning emergencies in children: Always supervise children closely, especially in areas where poisons are commonly stored, such as kitchens, bathrooms and garages. Keep children out of your work area when you are using potentially harmful substances. Consider all household or drugstore products to be potentially harmful.",

What to Do When a heat-related illness is recognized in its early stages, it usually can be reversed. Get the person out of the heat. Move the person to a cooler environment with circulating air. Loosen or remove as much clothing as possible and apply cool, wet cloths, such as towels or sheets, taking care to remoisten the cloths periodically (Fig. 6-3). Spraying the person with water and fanning also can help. If the person is conscious and able to swallow, give him or her small amounts of a cool \ufb02 uid such as a commercial sports drink or fruit juice to restore \ufb02 uids and electrolytes. Milk or water also may be given. Do not let the conscious person drink too quickly. Give about 4 ounces of \ufb02 uid every 15 minutes. Let the person rest in a comfortable position and watch carefully for changes in his or her condition.",

FOCUS ON PREVENTION LAYER YOUR WAY TO WARMTH As long as seasonal changes and cold climates exist, preventing cold-related emergencies, such as hypothermia, remains important when we work or play outside. The best way to ensure your comfort and warmth outdoors is to layer your clothing. The \ufb01 rst layer, called the base layer, is next to your skin. The base layer helps to regulate your body temperature by moving perspiration away from your skin. This is important because if perspiration gets trapped inside your clothes, you can become chilled rapidly, which can lead to hypothermia. Thermal underwear makes a good base layer for cold weather.",

Approximately 20 percent develop mild signals, such as fever and aches, which pass on their own. The risk of severe disease is higher for people 50 years and older. People typically develop signals of WNV between 3 and 14 days after an infected mosquito bites them. Signals of WNV include the following: High fever Headache Neck stiffness Confusion Coma Tremors Convulsions Muscle weakness Vision loss Numbness Paralysis These signals may last several weeks. In some cases, WNV can cause fatal encephalitis, which is a swelling of the brain that leads to death.

Never use repellents on an open wound or irritated skin. Use repellents sparingly. One application will last 4 to 8 hours. Heavier or more frequent applications do not increase effectiveness. If you suspect that you are having a reaction to a repellent, wash the treated skin immediately and call your health care provider.",

Scorpions live in dry regions such as the southwestern United States and Mexico. They live under rocks, logs and the bark of certain trees (Fig. 6-11). They are most active at night. Like spiders, only a few species of scorpions have a sting that can cause death. It is dif\ufb01 cult to distinguish highly poisonous scorpions from nonpoisonous scorpions. Therefore, all scorpion stings should be treated as medical emergencies.

Animal Bites The bite of a domestic or wild animal can cause infection and soft tissue injury. The most serious possible result is rabies. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of diseased animals such as skunks, bats, raccoons, cats, dogs, cattle and foxes. Animals with rabies may act strangely. For example, those that are usually active at night may be active in the daytime. A wild animal that usually tries to avoid people might not run from you.

What to Do Until Help Arrives If you encounter someone who has a marine-life sting: Get a lifeguard to remove the person from the water as soon as possible. If a lifeguard is not available, use a reaching assist, if possible (see Chapter 1). Avoid touching the person with your bare hands, which could expose you to the stinging tentacles. Use gloves or a towel when removing any tentacles. If you know the sting is from a jelly \ufb01 sh, irrigate the injured part with large amounts of vinegar as soon as possible for at least 30 seconds. This can help to remove the tentacles and stop the injection of venom. Vinegar works best to offset the toxin, but a baking soda slurry also may be used if vinegar is not available.",

LIGHTNING Every year, lightning causes more deaths in the United States than any other weather hazard, including blizzards, hurricanes, \ufb02 oods, tornadoes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The National Weather Service (NWS) estimates that lightning kills nearly 100 people annually and injures about 300 others. Lightning travels at speeds of up to 300 miles per second. Anything talla tower, tree or personcan become a path for the electrical current. A lightning strike can throw a person through the air, burn off clothes and cause the heart to stop beating. The most severe lightning strikes carry up to 50 million volts of electricity. This is enough electricity to light 13,000 homes. Lightning can \ufb02 ash over a persons body or it can travel through blood vessels and nerves to reach the ground. If a person survives a lightning strike, he or she may act confused.",

Prevent Lightning Injuries What to do before a possible lightning storm: Pick campsites that meet safety precautions. Know local weather patterns, especially in summertime. Plan turnaround times (the amount of time you need to get back) in lightning-prone areas, based on your research, and stick to the plan. During thunderstorms, use common sense to prevent being struck by lightning. If a thunderstorm threatens, the NWS advises people to: Postpone activities immediately, and not wait for rain to begin. Thunder and lightning can strike without rain. Watch cloud patterns and conditions for signs of an approaching storm. Designate safe locations and move or evacuate to a safe location at the \ufb01 rst sound of thunder. Every 5 seconds between the \ufb02 ash of lightning and the sound of thunder equals 1 mile of distance.",

An injury to the soft tissue commonly is called a wound. Any time the soft tissue is damaged or torn, the body is threatened. Injuries may damage the soft tissue at or near the skins surface or deep in the body. Severe bleeding can occur at the skins surface or beneath, where it is harder to detect. Germs can enter the body through the wound and cause infection. Wounds usually are classi\ufb01 ed as either closed or open.

Sometimes, however, the damaged blood vessel is too large or the pressure in the blood vessel is too great for the blood to clot, then bleeding can be life threatening. This can happen with both closed and open wounds. Closed Wounds The simplest closed wound is a bruise. A bruise develops when the body is bumped or hit, such as when you bump your leg on a table or chair (Fig. 7-2). The force of the blow to the body damages the soft tissue layers beneath the skin. This causes internal bleeding. Blood and other \ufb02 uids seep into the surrounding tissues, causing the area to swell and change color.",

To care for a closed wound, you can apply an ice pack to the area to decrease bleeding beneath the skin. Applying cold also can be effective in helping to control both pain and swelling (Fig. 7-3). Fill a plastic bag with ice and water or wrap ice in a wet cloth and apply it to the injured area for periods of about 20 minutes. Place a thin barrier between the ice and bare skin. Remove the ice and wait for 20 minutes before reapplying. If the person is not able to tolerate a 20minute application, apply the ice pack for periods of 10 minutes on and off. Elevating the injured part may help to reduce swelling; however, do not elevate the injured part if it causes more pain. Do not assume that all closed wounds are minor injuries.

Be sure that a person with an injured lower extremity does not bear weight on it until advised to do so by a medical professional. Open Wounds In an open wound, the break in the skin can be as minor as a scrape of the surface layers or as severe as a deep penetration. The amount of bleeding depends on the location and severity of the injury. The four main types of open soft tissue wounds are abrasions, lacerations, avulsions and punctures. Abrasions Abrasions are the most common type of open wound (Fig. 7-4). They usually are caused by something rubbing roughly against the skin. Abrasions do not bleed much. Any bleeding that occurs comes from capillaries (tiny blood vessels).",

Dirt and germs frequently have been rubbed into this type of wound, which is why it is important to clean and irrigate an abrasion thoroughly with soap and water to prevent infection. Other terms for an abrasion include a scrape, a rug burn, a road rash or a strawberry. Abrasions usually are painful because scraping of the outer skin layers exposes sensitive nerve endings. Lacerations A laceration is a cut in the skin, which commonly is caused by a sharp object, such as a knife, scissors or broken glass (Fig. 7-5). A laceration also can occur when a blunt force splits the skin. Deep lacerations may cut layers of fat and muscle, damaging both nerves and blood vessels. Bleeding may be heavy or there may be none at all. Lacerations are not always painful because damaged nerves cannot send pain signals to the brain. Infection can easily occur with lacerations if proper care is not given.",

CHAPTER 7  Soft Tissue Injuries 101Avulsions An avulsion is a serious soft tissue injury. It happens when a portion of the skin, and sometimes other soft tissue, is partially or completely torn away (Fig. 7-6). This type of injury often damages deeper tissues, causing signi\ufb01 cant bleeding. Sometimes a violent force may completely tear away a body part, including bone, such as a \ufb01 nger. This is known as an amputation. With amputations, sometimes bleeding is easier to control because the tissues close around the vessels at the injury site. If there is a violent tearing, twisting or crushing of the extremity, the bleeding may be hard to control. Punctures Punctures usually occur when a pointed object, such as a nail, pierces the skin (Fig. 7-7). A gunshot wound is a puncture wound.",

FIGURE 7-6 Avulsion FIGURE 7-7 Puncture 102 First AidCPRAED  Participants ManualFOCUS ON PREVENTION Tetanus is a severe infection that can result from a puncture or a deep cut. Tetanus is a disease caused by bacteria. These bacteria produce a powerful poison in the body. The poison enters the nervous system and can cause muscle paralysis. Once tetanus reaches the nervous system, its effects are highly dangerous and can be fatal. Fortunately, tetanus often can be successfully treated with medicines called antitoxins . One way to prevent tetanus is through immunizations. All of us need to have a shot to protect against tetanus.",

There are several types of manufactured tourniquets available and are preferred over makeshift (improvised) devices. For a manufactured tourniquet, always follow the manufacturers instructions. In general, the tourniquet is applied around the wounded extremity, just above the wound. The tag end of the strap is routed through the buckle, and the strap is pulled tightly, which secures the tourniquet in place. The rod (windlass) then is twisted to tighten the tourniquet until the bright-red bleeding stops. The rod then is secured in place (Fig. 7-18, AB).

A puncture injury can allow air to enter the chest through the wound. Air in the chest cavity does not allow the lungs to function normally. Puncture wounds cause varying degrees of internal and external bleeding. A puncture wound to the chest is a life-threatening injury. If the injury penetrates the rib cage, air can pass freely in and out of the chest cavity and the person cannot breathe normally. With each breath the person takes, you will hear a sucking sound coming from the wound. This sound is the primary signal of a penetrating chest injury called a sucking chest wound (Fig. 7-28).

They give the body shape and stability. Bones and muscles give the body shape and mobility. Tendons and ligaments connect to muscle and bones, giving support. They all work together to allow the body to move. Muscles Muscles are soft tissues. The body has over 600 muscles, most of which are attached to bones by strong tissues called tendons (Fig. 8-1). Unlike other soft tissues, muscles are able to shorten and lengthencontract and relax. This contracting and relaxing enables the body to move.",

The skeleton protects many of the organs inside the body. Bones are hard and dense. Because they are strong and rigid, they are not injured easily. Bones have a rich supply of blood and nerves. Bone injuries can bleed and usually are painful. If care is not given for the injury, the bleeding can become life threatening. Children have more \ufb02 exible bones than adults; their bones break less easily. But if a child sustains a fracture to a growth plate (areas of developing cartilage near the ends of long bones), it can affect future bone growth. Bones weaken with age. Older adults have more brittle bones. Sometimes they break surprisingly easily.

Strong, tough bands called ligaments hold the bones at a joint together. All joints have a normal range of movement in which they can move freely, without too much stress or strain. When joints are forced beyond this range, ligaments stretch and tear. TYPES OF INJURIES The four basic types of injuries to muscles, bones and joints are fractures, dislocations, sprains and strains. They occur in a variety of ways. Fractures A fracture is a complete break, a chip or a crack in a bone (Fig. 8-4). A fall, a blow or sometimes even a twisting movement can cause a fracture. Fractures are open or closed. An open fracture involves an open wound. It occurs when the end of a bone tears through the skin. An object that goes into the skin and breaks the bone, such as a bullet, also can cause an open fracture. In a closed fracture the skin is not broken.",

The disease is caused by a decrease in calcium content of the bones. Normal bones are hard, dense tissues that endure great stresses. Calcium is a key to bone growth, development and repair. When the calcium content of bones decreases, bones become frail and less dense. They are less able to repair the normal damage they incur. This leaves bones, especially hip, back and wrist, more prone to fractures. These fractures may occur with only a little force. Some even occur without force. The person may be taking a walk or washing dishes when the fracture occurs.

Since generally only x-rays, CAT scans or MRIs can show the severity of a head, neck or spinal injury, you should always care for such injuries as if they were serious. An injury to the brain can cause bleeding inside the skull (Fig. 8-14). The blood can build up and cause pressure, resulting in more damage.

Concussion A concussion is a type of brain injury that involves a temporary loss of brain function resulting from a blow to the head. A person with a concussion may not always lose consciousness. The effects of a concussion can appear immediately or very soon after the blow to the head and include sleep, mood and cognitive disturbances, and sensitivity to light and noise.

What to Look For Although painful, a simple broken rib rarely is life threatening. A person with a broken rib generally remains calm. However, a person with a broken rib will take small, shallow breaths because normal or deep breathing is uncomfortable or painful. The person usually will attempt to ease the pain by supporting the injured area with a hand or arm. If the injury is serious, the person will have trouble breathing.

For example, children, older adults, persons with disabilities and persons who speak a different language than your own have special needs and considerations that affect the care you give. In some emergencies, special circumstances, such as an emergency childbirth or a hostile situation, create additional challenges. In any case, there are steps you can take to be better prepared to respond appropriately. In this chapter, you will explore ways to recognize and respond to special situations and circumstances.",

Colic Colic is a condition in which an otherwise healthy infant cries more than 3 hours a day, for more than 3 days a week, between the ages of 3 weeks and 3 months. The crying usually starts suddenly at about the same time each day. Colic generally starts to improve at about 6 weeks. It often disappears by the time a baby is 12 weeks old. Causes of colic may include intestinal gas, food sensitivity or allergy, or an immature nervous system. A baby with colic may have a red face and tense, hard belly because the stomach muscles tighten during crying. A baby with colic also may clench his or her legs, feet and \ufb01 sts when crying.",

To prevent diaper rash and help it to heal: Keep the area as dry as possible by changing wet or soiled diapers immediately. Clean the area with water and a soft washcloth. Avoid wipes that can dry the childs skin. Pat the skin dry or let it air dry. Keep the diaper loose so wet and soiled parts do not rub against the skin.

It is not thought to be hereditary, but it does tend to recur in families. Because of these factors, there is no way of knowing if a child is at risk for SIDS. Sometimes it is mistaken for child abuse because of the unexplained death in an apparently healthy child. In addition, SIDS sometimes causes bruise-like blotches to appear on the infants body.

They are quickly becoming the fastest growing age group in the United States. Since 1900, life expectancy in the United States has increased by over 60 percent. In 1900, for example, the average life expectancy was 46 years for men and 48 years for women. Today, it is 75 years for men and 80 years for women. The main explanations for the increase in life expectancy are medical advancements and improvements in health care.Normal aging brings about changes. People age at different rates, and each persons organs and body parts age at different rates as well. For example, a person with wrinkled, fragile skin may have strong bones or excellent respiratory function. Overall, however, body function generally de clines as we age.

In fact, falls are the leading cause of death from injury for older adults. Falls in older adults are due to slower re\ufb02 exes, failing eyesight and hearing, arthritis and problems such as unsteady balance and movement.

CHAPTER 10 CHAPTER 10  Asthma 149ASTHMA Asthma is an illness in which certain substances or conditions, called triggers, cause in\ufb02 ammation and constriction of the airways (small tubes in the lungs through which we breathe), making breathing dif\ufb01 cult. Triggers of an asthma attack include exercise, cold air, allergens or irritants, such as perfume. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that over 23 million Americans were affected by asthma. Asthma is more common in children and young adults. However, its frequency and severity is increasing in all age groups in the United States. Asthma is the third-ranking cause of hospitalization among those younger than 15 years. People diagnosed with asthma can reduce the risk of an attack by controlling environmental variables when possible.",

It is, however, important to know what to do to prevent an asthma attack. Things to keep in mind when you have exercise-induced asthma include the following: Take prescribed medications 30 to 60 minutes before exercising. Slowly warm up before exercising. Cool down gently after exercising. Make sure that you drink plenty of \ufb02 uids during exercise. Seek and follow the advice of your health care provider. If participating in organized sports, notify the coach of your condition.",

Using Medications to Control Asthma People who have been diagnosed with asthma will have a personalized medication plan. They should take all medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. Asthma medications are available in two forms: long-term control and quick relief. Long-Term Control Medications Long-term control medications prevent or reverse in\ufb02 ammation (swelling) in the airway. They also help to decrease sensitivity, which helps to keep the airways from reacting to asthma triggers. The long-term control medicines work slowly. They help to control asthma over many hours. They should be taken every day whether or not signals of asthma are present. Quick-Relief Medications Quick-relief or rescue medications are used to stop an asthma attack. These medications work quickly to relieve the sudden swelling. They lessen wheezing, coughing and chest tightness.",

Methods of Delivery The most common way to take long-term control and quick-relief asthma medications is by inhaling them. Inhalation allows the medication to reach the airways faster and work quickly. There also are fewer side effects. Medications are inhaled using a metered dose inhaler (MDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a small-volume nebulizer (Fig. 10-1). Both long-term and quick-relief medications also are available in pill and liquid form. In addition, long-term medications are available in the form of an injection given just under the skin. FIGURE 10-1 Long-term and quick-release medications are inhaled using an MDI, a DPI or a small-volume nebulizer.

In 2007, American also sustained approximately 34.3 million nonfatal injuries that required medical attention. Injury Risk Factors Several factors affect a persons risk of being injured. These factors include age, gender, geographic location, economic status and alcohol misuse and abuse. Nonfatal injury rates remain highest among people younger than 39 years; however, deaths from injury are more common in people 40 years of age and older. Also of note is this age group has the highest rate of injuries that result in death. Gender also is a signi\ufb01 cant factor in risk of injury. Males are at greater risk than females for any type of injury.",
