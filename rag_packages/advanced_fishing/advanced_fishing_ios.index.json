PFDs are strongly recom - mended for all anglers when fishing near deep or swift water. If leading a group of youngsters in these conditions, they should be mandatory.

As you plan to go fishing, you need to know where to place your bait. Habitat features that typically attract fish will be described.",

Section 1. TACKLE Fishing tackle is the connection between the angler and the fish. The fishing tackle is necessary both to get the lure or bait to the fish and to get the fish to the angler. A. Fishing Pole Selection Fishing poles are named for the reel (or lack of reel) that holds the fishing line. Each type of fishing reel has an appropriate fishing rod that goes with it. 1. Pole and Line . (Figure 1 ). The simplest gear is a pole with fishing line attached to the end. It is used with a float and hook or lure. This gear is simple yet very effective for fish in shallow water. 2. Spincast Gear . (Figure 2 ). Spincast gear, a simple rod with a reel, is usually the appropriate rod and reel for beginning anglers. The fishing line comes out of a hole in the reel cover.",

Ask your bait and tackle dealer what is appropriate for the species you are trying to catch and the bait you are using. The size fishing line or leader you are using should be dependent on the size hook you are using. If you get nibbles, but you are not catching them, switch to a smaller hook.Section 3.

Retrieving This is the act of bringing a bait or lure back to the angler ( Figure 12). After casting, live and prepared bait are often left in one spot until retrieved. Some baits and most artifi - cial lures are most effectively pre - sented while retrieving. The retrieve can be slow or fast; it can be steady or erratic. E. Setting the Hook Once the fish bites the lure, the hook must be pulled into the fish to hold the fish. If using barbed hooks, pull hard enough to pull the barb into the jaw.

Choosing Where to Fish Some fishing areas are better than others. The quality of fish - ing depends upon the waters productivity, the fish species present, and the size of the fish present. Productive water has more fish than unproductive water; up to a point, the greener the water is, the more productive the water. In some waters, undesirable fish compete with desirable fish. Fishing is better in a lake with a high proportion of the right size fish. Check the fishing forecast for predicted hot spots.

In streams and rivers, anglers focus on riffles, the swift areas that bring food into the deep, slower portions. Fish congregate in this area and feed more actively as water begins to rise and carry more food. Also you should try areas that fish use for resting. Fish rest in areas where the current is slowed by rocks, trees or in eddies near the swift water. Current attracts fish in reservoirs as well as in streams. Current flow rates are higher under bridges; therefore, bank fishing from highway bridge approaches or near bridges from a boat can be good. Safety should be a top priority in these bank areas, including the use of life jackets. The areas below dams are called tailwaters.

To keep your cooler clean and to keep fish out of the water, use a plastic bag to isolate your catch. 22 - BASIC FISHING BASIC FISHING - 23C. Cleaning Your Catch. After you leave the water with your catch, you want to properly prepare it for eating. There are two different ways to clean your catch: filleting and dressing. 1. Filleting (Figures 15-19 ) involves cutting the edible part of the fish away from the inedible part; no bones are left in the edible portion. 2. Dressing (Figures 20-22 ) implies taking off parts that cannot be eaten, and most bones are left with the edible portion. Some fish, like catfish, have a skin that must be removed ( Figures 23 and 24). Other fish have to be scaled with a knife or a spoon ( Figure 20 ). Figure 15.",

Using a fillet knife, lift that fat and dark area out. (1) Make a v-cut the full length of the fillet from both sides of the dark area. (2) Now lift out the dark meat out, gently cutting underneath it, and discard that portion. Next look on both edges of the fil - let for white or yellow fat.
