If you add an energy storage system to your solar array, you gain even more control over your energy usage and costs. High-quality solar systems are a reliable power source. The sun rises and sets every day, and when the sun shines, solar panels generate electricity. While the weather and seasons vary, the amount of electricity that solar panels generate is predictable, and you can plan accordingly to get all the love from the sun you need to power your home. LG Solars high-efficiency panels are designed to capture more of the sun, more of the time too, which helps expand how you power your home.

This conversion takes place within the solar cells and is a process that requires no moving parts. A solar inverter is one of the most important elements of the solar system.

Aluminum rails with clamps attach the solar panels to the rail and connection brackets fix the rail to the roof (see diagram below). Superior mounting systems are manufactured with higher grades of aluminum and stainless steel, often resulting in less weight on the roof and lower levels of corrosion over longer periods of time. Quality mounting rails may also feature robust anchoring points and design solutions that speed up the installation time of your solar system.MOUNTING SYSTEMS There are two fundamental steps to take when connecting your solar system to the grid.

If your solar modules are in the shade, the system will generate less electricity. Even a single antenna or a chimney shadow on your panels can affect performance, while the overall effectiveness of your solar system is dependent on where you live.
