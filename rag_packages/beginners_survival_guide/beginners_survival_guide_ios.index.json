Now, solar energy can power a home throughout the day and greatly reduce how much a family spends on energy each year.\n\nThose who don\u2019t take advantage of the natural energy of the sun will always pay for their electricity. Paying for electricity never goes away, no matter how much or little you use.\n\nBy harnessing the power of solar energy, you own a major part of the power you use.

In order to give buyers some guidance about the level of expected degradation, a warranty is offered by most manufacturers. This warranty lasts, in most cases, for 25 years and guarantees, for conventional panels, an output of around 80% of the original capacity. LG guarantees up to 90.08% efficiency for the NeON\u00ae 2 and the LG NeON\u00ae R guarantees up to 90.8% efficiency with a 25-year performance warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, this warranty can easily cause confusion.

Performance Warranty: Many manufacturers will offer 10 years\u2019 performance warranty and an 80.2% performance efficiency warranty at 25 years (LG guarantees 89.6% with the NeON\u00ae 2). For the average consumer, it becomes difficult\n\nto separate the \u201cwheat from the chaff.\u201d Companies like LG offer a full labor warranty and a product replacement warranty. Finally, make sure that the manufacturer has a local legal entity in the U.S. Should you have a dispute in the years to come, a company with no link and contact in the U.S. may be hard to communicate with when it comes to consumer rights.\n\n9. Choose a quality inverter solution to go with quality panels: An inverter is the heart of your solar system. It will have a direct impact on the efficiency of conversion from solar energy to usable electric power. The more efficient the inverter solution, the better",
