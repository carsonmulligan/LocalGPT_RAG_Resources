This mucous membrane is supported on a complexly con- voluted bony structure. Its structure is such as to present a maximum surface with a minimum obstruction to the circulation of air. By comparison,. the human olfactory apparatus is crude, yet even the human nose can detect chemicals borne by the air in such minute quantity that they cannot be identified by the most sensitive chemical tests.

Any Shepherd can trail a rabbit or a woodchuck. Only a few will, on command, follow the trail of a stranger leading through traffic, under snow, near a kennel full of dogs, or past a woodchuck hole.

A most striking difference between the retina of a dogs eye and that of a human is that the dogs retina lacks a fovea centralis, which is a small rodless area of the retina that affords acute vision. When a man focuses his eyes upon any object, the light reflected from that object is thrown upon the fovea centralis. He can see many other objects-besides that one, but he sees them indistinctly. This can be tested readily enough by focusing the eyes upon any word on this printed page and then trying to see how many other words can be read without moving the eyes. The words reflected upon the nonfoveal portions of the retina are blurred and poorly defined.",

Basic Considerations. (1) Relation to handler. A few dogs will work willingly for only certain people, often for only a single individual. Most dogs show unwillingness when commanded by a AGO 5344B 9 stranger. Some have proved to be stubborn regardless of who trains and handles them. It is evident that the best results are obtained when a dog and man are carefully matched. A dogs rating for unwillingness should be only in relation to his handler. A dog should be penalized in his rating on this trait if he readily shifts his willing- ness to another man; for example, to a stranger or prisoner. (2) Variances in willingness.

The second thousand will be tattooed OAOO, OA01, 0A02, and so on up to 9A99. The third thousand will be tattooed OOAO, OOA1, 00A2, and so on up to 99A9.

A good brushing keeps a dog clean and maintains his coat and skin in a heathly condition. If his coat is brushed properly each day, it is seldom necessary to bathe him. A dog must be kept free of fleas, lice, and ticks. A dogs appearance denotes his state of health as well as the care he receives and reflects directly on his handler. 25. Coat a. German Shepherds have a double coat: the undercoat is com- posed of soft, woolly hair and the outer coat is composed of coarse hair, somewhat oily and water resistant. The coat offers protec- tion from rain and excessive heat and cold. b. It is important to give the coat a daily brushing. First, give the dog a good brisk rubdown with the fingertips to loosen dead skin. Follow the rubdown with a thorough but gentle brushing. The coat should be brushed twice, first against and then with the grain.",

A normal, healthy dog should be bathed as often as is neces- sary. His skin is rich in oil glands and deficient in sweat glands.

The handler may note that a dog will eat the meal provided and immediately go to the water bowl. Usually he will drink a few laps and go away. Occa- sionally, a dog will drink excessive quantities of water, which causes him to vomit. In such cases, it may be necessary to ration the water in small quantities at frequent intervals. If the vomiting condition persists, it should be brought to the attention of the veterinarian. 38. Cereals and Cereal Products Cereal grains and certain cereal products are not greatly relished by dogs. Such foods should be given, however, since they supply bulk, energy, protein, some vitamins, and minerals. Cereals may constitute a third of the total feed for mature dogs. The cereal grains most commonly used for dog feeding are corn, rice, oats, wheat, and barley. a.",

Ordinarily, one meal a day is enough for a mature dog. To bring an underweight dog to proper working condition, he may be fed a supplemental ration of milk, eggs, cereal, or additional normal rations in excess of four pounds per day. c. Time of Feeding. The time of feeding depends on whether the dog is to work on the night or day shift. He must never be fed his ration just before he goes to work and never immediately after strenuous exercise.

The pulse may be felt on the left side just in back of the elbow joint, or by placing the fingertips lightly on the femoral artery which is located on the inside of each hind leg. The beats should be counted for 30 seconds and multiplied by two. The animal should be at perfect rest when the pulse is taken, as exercise and excitement quickens it. In illness, the pulse is usually faster than normal and may be stronger or weaker. Figure 7. An alert healthy dog. AGO 5344B 27 f. Mucous Membranes of the Eyes, Nose, and Mouth.

Indications of Disease Every disease has different indications and the symptoms vary so greatly that only exhaustive study can acquaint one with their many indications. The most common preliminary indications of disease are partial or complete loss of appetite, rise in temperature, accelerated breathing, increased pulse rate, listlessness, dejected appearance, nasal discharge, persistent cough, diarrhea, constipa- tion, unhealthy coat of hair, and swelling in any part of the body.",

Communicable diseases are diseases that are transmitted from animal to animal either by direct con- tact between sick and well, or indirectly through the medium of infected kennels, unsanitary feeding dishes, flies, lice, ticks, mosquitoes, and faulty sanitation. A dis- eased animal throws off in the discharges from the res- piratory, digestive, and urinary systems the material which transmits the disease to other susceptible animals. Some of these diseases are incurable, some may be trans- mitted to man, and all may cause great harm if not held in check. Communicable diseases are always marked by a period of incubation, which is the time interval that elapses between infection and the appearance of the symptoms of the disease.",

Conditions that lower general vital- ity and natural resistance to disease, thereby making dogs more susceptible to infection, are termed predisposing causes. The principal causes are exposure, improper 28 AGO 5344B grooming, lack of sufficient food, overwork, and other diseases. (3) Prevention. The logical way to prevent the entrance of communicable disease is to correct the faulty conditions that predispose the animal.

Many of these diseases are directly caused by improper methods of animal management. While noncommunicable diseases are the cause of many lost days of animal service, they do not present the serious problems encoun- tered in communicable diseases. Examples of noncommunicable diseases are tumors, epilepsy, and nutritional disturbances. 46. Nursing a. Good nursing is indispensable in the treatment of sick and injured dogs. The chief points to consider in nursing are- (1) Ventilation. Allow plenty of fresh air, but protect the dog from drafts. Avoid exposure to extreme tempera- tures and, in the field, provide shelter from wind and rain. (2) Bedding.",

A break in the skin, body tissues, or lining of a body cavity, resulting from external violence or muscular activity of the body itself, is known as a wound. For the purpose of descrip- tion, wounds are classified as incised wounds or cuts, lacerated wounds or tears, punctured wounds or holes, and abrasions. (1) Incised wounds or cuts are caused by sharp objects. Al- though this type of wound bleeds freely due to the cut blood vessels, there is very little tissue destruction and infection does not often follow if proper care and treat- ment is given. (2) Lacerated wounds or tears involve a destruction of tissue, and create a likely seat of infection. Bleeding is not as severe as in incised wounds.",

Hemorrhage in this type of wound is of little concern unless a large blood vessel is severed.

Bruises, strains, sprains, and fractures are classified as injuries. They are caused by external violence or from muscular activity of the body itself, and involve muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, organs, and bones. A break in the skin need not accompany an injury. d. First Aid Treatment of Injuries. (1) Bruises and sprains. The application of hot or cold packs to bruises, sprains, and strains will prove beneficial. Com- plete rest is essential. (2) Fractures. Most fractures occur in the extremities of the body. The causes are varied, but the greater number of cases result from falls, kicks, bites from other animals, and gunshot wounds. Before attempting to administer first aid, secure the dogs mouth with a muzzle.",

Bandages are one of the oldest forms of surgical appa- ratus and are employed-under varying conditions for many pur- poses. The chief uses for bandages are to-- (1) Control bleeding by pressure. (2) Hold dressings and compresses in place. (3) Hold splints in place. (4) Immobilize a part of the body. b. Application. (1) The roller bandage is the type most frequently used for applying dressings, splints, compresses, and pressure.

They attach themselves to dogs and receive nourishment by sucking blood. They cause the dog considerable annoyance and, in large numbers, may produce chronic skin eruptions. They also cause the dog to inflict self-injury by persistent scratching. Fleas on the dog can be destroyed by applying flea powder or by bathing the dog in a 1 to 2 percent solution of creolin. b.

It is essential to make the dog carry out the same command over and over until he learns to respond to it without hesitating. Repetition is even more important in dog training than it is in human learning. However, both handler and dog can go stale or lose efficiency by practicing any one command too much during one period.

Their physical well-being depends, primarily, on the willingness of the handler to do such manual labor as necessary for kennel management, feeding, and dog cleanliness. Failure in these responsibilities means failure of the training program. h. Security Clearance. Since dogs will be guarding sensitive installations, it is imperative for the handler to have a security clearance. 57.",

Training the dog to work off the leash follows the same pro- cedure as that described for working on the leash. During all off- leash work, the handler depends on the tone of his voice and on command gestures to direct his dog, as well as the affection which has been established between him and his dog, and the attitude of obedience learned by the dog. Nevertheless, the handler must be alert in noticing any hesitancy on the part of the dog to comply with his commands and must be able to prevent his dog from breaking or getting out of position.

It serves simply, but necessarily, to develop in dogs the behavior that is essential to efficient and effective training for specific military functions. A dog that successfully completes basic training is disciplined and prepared to receive instruction in mili- tary duties. Furthermore, his behavior during basic training, if properly observed, is an indication of the type of specialized train- ing for which he is best suited. 101.",

The Dog Must be Trained for Only One Job. He may learn to be a good scout or sentry dog, but never both. Because of his natural limitations, any effort to train him for more than one job will diminish the contribution he can make. b. The General Attitude of the Handler is All-Important. A handler must fully realize the importance of the work that he is doing. He must understand and appreciate the fact that dogs are used to conserve manpower, conserve life, and to further the work of the military service through the use of their peculiar powers. c. The Importance of the Handler-Dog Relationship Cannot be Overestimated. The dog and his handler must work as a team. Therefore, no handler must be forced to train an animal that he deems unsuitable.",

The scout dog is trained to detect and give silent warning of the presence of any: strange individual or group. He will prove especially useful in warning of ambushes and attempts at infiltra- tion.

The wind is probably the most important and, at the same time, the most variable factor a handler has to contend with in employing a scout dog to the best advantage. It is the wind that carries the all-important human scent to the dog-or away from him. A handler must therefore always be wind-conscious. He should learn all he can about wind habits, and he should be able to feel or sense what direction the wind is blowing at any time with- out having to rely on such expedients as dropping dust or a handful of hair from his dogs back and noting its direction of drift.

Wind hitting a hilltop or the crest of a hill is prone to break into two or three smaller streams. A small table top mesa is probably the worst place for a dog to try to find a hidden man. Scents borne by the wind off a mesa may be scattered, blown aloft, or die before they come in contact with ground level.

During rains, scents remain close to their source. (2) Human scents from foxholes become borne by the wind because scents rise as they evaporate.

It is advisable to loosen an inch or two of the earth around the stake so that the stake will give a little when the dog lunges and not check him too sharply. (2) Teaching the dog to detect a strangers presence or ap- proach. The dog must learn to detect the presence of a human in partial or complete concealment either below, at, or above ground level. For this reason, the final stage of sentry training must include patrols in areas where decoys are concealed in such places as the branches of a tree, behind a fence, or in a ditch. It is desirable to work the dog on the 25-foot leash, as well as the short leash, so that he can enter buildings and other suspected places of concealment ahead of the handler.

Additional Training Notes a. Importance of Loose Heeling. In walking a post, loose heel- ing is essential as long as the dog does not pull or tug on the leash.

Importance of Distrust of Strangers. The sentry dog is taught not to make friends with strangers. The handler walks his dog on leash at the heel position. A stranger approaches uttering soothing words and coaxes the dog to come to him. As soon as the dog starts to respond with friendliness, the stranger slaps him smartly on the nose and jumps away. The handler then encourages the dog to attack the stranger. This is repeated with different people acting as strangers until the dog growls and barks on the approach of all strangers, no matter how friendly their attitude or how much they attempt to appease the dog.

Section V. ADVANCED OBEDIENCE AND AGITATION TRAINING 119. Advanced Obedience a. Advanced obedience training consists of requiring the dog to run an obstacle course and to perform all exercises off leash and without the use of command gestures. Since sentry dogs are nor- mally used at night when gestures are useless, it is essential to train them to understand and obey vocal commands. This advanced training allows the handler to acquire increased control over his dog and develops in the dog the discipline necessary for effective military service. b. At the start of obedience training, the dogs are well separated to minimize the possibility of fights. A dog that attempts to attack another should be muzzled immediately as punishment.",

Obstacle Course As in the case of human beings, sentry dogs cannot be expected to maintain peak efficiency unless they are in top physical condi- tion. This means that, in addition to receiving proper food and 98 AGO 5344B medical care, they must be exercised frequently, regularly, and strenuously. An obstacle course (fig. 38) which may be constructed out of natural or salvage materials, provides an excellent medium for such exercise. All units which have sentry dogs assigned should have an obstacle course constructed.",

Agitation a. Advanced agitation training consists of teasing the dog to the extent of making him bite at the agitator. The agitator wears the extra sleeve (with or without the attack suit) to give the dog something to actually bite. He uses a light switch or burlap bag to irritate the dog. For the more dangerous exercises in agitation training, the agitator may wear a fencers face mask for added protection (figs. 39, 40 and 42).

In this exercise; the dog is made to heel on leash at the left side of the handler, while a prisoner walks in front and slightly to the left of the dog (fig. 44). The prisoner suddenly turns in a threatening manner or starts to run away. The handler drops the leash and the dog, if well trained, will attack. At first, the handler may need to com- mand GET HIM.

Oral commands should always be given with the same words, in the same tone, and at the same rate of speed. b. Do not punish your dog for failure to execute a command unless you are certain that he understands what you want. c. Reward follows promptly after each act done properly; punishment follows every act of disobedience. d. To punish a dog at any time other than instantly after he has committed a wrong act is cruelty rather than training. e. Training periods should not be too long as a dog tires quickly and will go sour on the lesson. f. If a dog does one step wrong, do not repeat this step only. Begin again, for a dog must learn acts in their entirety to carry them out successfully. g. Never fool your dog, he has a sense of humiliation and pride. He is to always understand that when you say a certain word, a certain thing will happen.",
