On the school field will be very manageable if every child took a board with them and if it\u2019s a sunny day the clay can be left to dry outside too! A woodland theme where children can design their clay into owls, squirrels, foxes, badgers, mushrooms, leaves, etc. looks very appealing around the school grounds and also fits into the natural environment well, especially if your school has trees and lots of greenery. Children can pound, pinch, roll, flatten, poke, tear, squeeze, coil, stretch, squash, twist, and bend their clay into all sorts of shapes and sizes. Making it a really enjoyable material to work with. Ask children if they know where clay comes from? How it is made?\n\nEAL/SEN: Working with the clay will provide a good break from using pencils, crayons, paint brushes, or other tools as the children are all free to express themselves and t",
