GeneralThe dog's world differs from that of humans in some very specificways. His world is mostly one of odors. His nose tells him count-less things about his environment which entirely escape humans.He is more sensitive to sounds than humans. His visual sensitivityto the movement of objects is superior to that of humans. The dog'ssenses which concern the trainer chiefly are, in the sequence oftheir probable importance, smell, hearing, vision, and touch.5. Breeda. The German Shepherd is the only breed acceptable for train-ing as military scout and sentry dogs.b. The German Shepherd is a working dog of'wolflike appear-ance, with a medium-size, muscular body.

The special traits that make the German Shepherd so desir-able as a military dog are his outstandingly keen nose, endurance,reliability, speed, power, courage, and temperament.6. Sensesa.

SensitivityThe term \"sensitivity\" refers to the type and degree of responsea dog shows to certain stimuli (sound and touch). An oversensitivedog is startled by stimuli of lower intensity than is required to dis-turb the average dog. He often responds to weak stimuli by trem-bling and cowering or fleeing. A normal dog might react to thesame stimuli with a mere turn of his head.a. Oversensitive Dog. A dog that is oversensitive (shy) is sohandicapped that it is not likely to demonstrate what intelligenceit possesses in a form which the trainer can utilize.

Many diseases andinjuries are preventable if all who are concerned with the dogs arevigilant, intelligent, and untiring in the application of simple pre-ventive measures. Frequently, the development of serious diseasesor injuries can be prevented by prompt first aid measures and earlytreatment.43.

Communicable diseases are diseases that aretransmitted from animal to animal either by direct con-tact between sick and well, or indirectly through themedium of infected kennels, unsanitary feeding dishes,flies, lice, ticks, mosquitoes, and faulty sanitation. A dis-eased animal throws off in the discharges from the res-piratory, digestive, and urinary systems the materialwhich transmits the disease to other susceptible animals.Some of these diseases are incurable, some may be trans-mitted to man, and all may cause great harm if not heldin check.

Accustoming the dog to this new equip-ment depends entirely on patience and practice.96. MuzzleAfter adjusting the muzzle on the dog (fig. 30), the handlerstarts heeling him at a fast walk on leash. If the dog tries to reachup with a front paw and pull off the muzzle, the handler jerksupward with the leash and keeps on walking, holding the leashtaut. As soon as the dog stops trying to remove the muzzle, thehandler slackens the leash and praises him.AGO 5344B 73\n\n97.

Screening ProcedureThe term \"screening\" refers to the procedure used to classifydogs for the type of military service for which they seem bestqualified. This classification is based on observation of the physicaland psychological traits manifested by the dogs from the time theyare given the tests on arrival at reception and training centers(pars. 14-18), throughout the basic training period, and even afterthey have begun specialized training.

Statement of PrinciplesThe effectiveness of specialized dog training depends on the re-gard shown for the following fundamental principles:a. The Dog Must be Trained for Only One Job. He may learn tobe a good scout or sentry dog, but never both. Because of hisnatural limitations, any effort to train him for more than one jobwill diminish the contribution he can make.b.

The sentry dog, as the name implies, is used principally oninterior guard duty as a watchdog. This type of dog is trained togive warning to his handler by growling or barking, or by silentalert. He is habitually worked on leash. The handler, keeping thedog on leash, patrols his post and can depend on the dog to notifyhim of the approach or presence of strangers in or about the areabeing protected (fig. 36).

The agitator wearsthe extra sleeve (with or without the attack suit) to give the dogsomething to actually bite. He uses a light switch or burlap bagto irritate the dog.

Oral commands should always be given with the same words,in the same tone, and at the same rate of speed.b. Do not punish your dog for failure to execute a commandunless you are certain that he understands what you want.c. Reward follows promptly after each act done properly;punishment follows every act of disobedience.d. To punish a dog at any time other than instantly after he hascommitted a wrong act is cruelty rather than training.e. Training periods should not be too long as a dog tires quicklyand will go sour on the lesson.f. If a dog does one step wrong, do not repeat this step only.Begin again, for a dog must learn acts in their entirety to carrythem out successfully.g. Never fool your dog,",
