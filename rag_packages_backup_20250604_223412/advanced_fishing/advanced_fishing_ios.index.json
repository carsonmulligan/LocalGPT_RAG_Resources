You are about to join the\n\nranks of thousands of like-minded anglers \u2013 some of the best conservationists on earth. Each of them started right where\n\nyou are today\u2026as a beginner. You will learn from experience and from friends and family. You will share lifetime memories with them. As a parent, I realize how important time management has become. My own family must plan to enjoy family activities and events. You are beginning an activity that takes practice and patience to become successful. Try to keep this in mind\u2026fishing is a life-long sporting challenge. It is one you will be able to pass to your children and future generations. It is time well spent.\n\nFish is definitely good food, and time spent with family is a\n\ntreasure, but time spent fishing is also healthy for you.

After learning how to assemble the fishing equipment and stringing the line, budding anglers will experience knot tying and simple techniques used to cast. They will then learn to hook appropriate bait to catch common fish. In all cases, we hope these lessons lead to fishing adventures.\n\nAs you plan to go fishing, you need to know where to place your bait. Habitat features that typically attract fish will be described. We certainly hope you catch fish, so fish handling, cleaning and preparation of the catch will also be discussed.\n\nSection 1. TACKLE\n\nFishing tackle is the connection between the angler and the fish. The fishing tackle is necessary both to get the lure or bait to the fish and to get the fish to the angler.\n\nA.

This gear is simple yet very effective for fish in shallow water.\n\n2. Spincast Gear. (Figure 2). Spincast gear, a simple rod with a reel, is usually the appropriate rod and reel for beginning anglers. The fishing line comes out of a hole in the reel cover. The thumb button releases the line or stops the line from going too far. Spincast gear is used to cast light to medium size lures.\n\n3. Spinning Gear. (Figure 3). Spinning reels can cast farther than spincast gear. The fishing line on a spinning reel is exposed, and the index finger is used to release the line and to control the line.

Most hooks and lures are more effective without snaps or snap-swivels attached. Crank baits (wobbling lures) are the ex- ception. If you are trying a variety of lures, a small but strong snap will make changing lures easier. A swivel or three-way swivel can be used to attach a dropper that keeps bait or lures off the bottom.\n\nWeights or Sinkers. Only enough weight should be used to cast the bait and keep it at the desired depth. More weight will be needed in windy weather or swift water. To prevent losing a fish, weights should be at- tached carefully, especially when they clamp on\n\nthe fishing line directly between the hook and the angler.\n\nFloats.

(If a friend is helping, have him/her pull line from the pole, while you hold the pole as if fighting a fish). The other way is to use a weight that is equal to 1/3 the tensile strength of your line.

GOING FISHING A. Think Safety\n\nWhen taking a new person fishing, it is important they have an enjoyable experience. Therefore, find a pond, lake or stream that is safe and easily fished. As they learn and advance their skills, new chal- lenges can be introduced; however, always include the safety equip- ment required for the new situation.\n\nBASIC FISHING - 15\n\n14 - BASIC FISHING\n\nB. Choosing Where to Fish\n\nSome fishing areas are better than others. The quality of fish- ing depends upon the water\u2019s productivity, the fish species present, and the size of the fish present. Productive water has more fish than unproductive water; up to a point, the greener the water is, the more prod",

Productive water has more fish than unproductive water; up to a point, the greener the water is, the more productive the water. In some waters, undesirable fish compete with desirable fish. Fishing is better in a lake with a high proportion of the right size fish. Check the fishing forecast for predicted \u201chot spots.\u201d Habitat is the key to fish survival, and fishing near habitat will result in more bites. Stumps, weed beds, and man-made fish attrac- tors are all good examples of fish habitat. During summer, fish can be found near fishing or boating docks, as they prefer shaded areas.\n\nfarm ponds\n\nIn streams and rivers, anglers focus on riffles, the swift areas that\n\nbring food into the deep, slower portions.

By sharing information with new anglers, we help them be successful while learning the variety of fishing techniques.\n\nLive bait simulates food items that fish normally eat. Bait that is alive and moving after you hook it will catch more fish. Some bait is available year-round and some is seasonal.

CARING FOR THE CATCH Before your fishing trip begins, you should plan how you will care\n\nfor your catch. The decision to catch and release or keep should be made before you catch your first fish.\n\nA. Catch and Release\n\nIf the decision is to release fish, all fish should be handled as little as possible and fish should be returned to the water as quickly as pos- sible. The best method is to hold the fish in the water, reach to the fish and remove the hook with needle nose pliers (Figure 14). If you need to remove the fish from the water, return it as quickly as possible. In warmer water, moving the fish back and forth with water entering the mouth will help the fish recover more quickly.

By limiting your consumption rate, selecting smaller fish to eat (less time to accu- mulate pollutants), removing as much of the potentially polluted flesh (fat) as possible, and cooking it properly, you lower your risk dramatically. For more information on fish advisories, see your state\u2019s fishing guide.\n\n2\n\nE. Caring for Cleaned Fish.\n\nOnce fish are cleaned, they should be washed thoroughly, then\n\nfrozen immediately or refrigerated and cooked within three days. Frozen fish may develop freezer burn unless they are tightly wrapped or frozen in water. When freezing fish in water, you should use just enough water to cover them. Plastic freezer bags work well for fillets, if they can be sealed without leaking.\n\nThere are numerous cookbooks that have a variety of recipes and\n\nmethods for cooking fish for the tab",
