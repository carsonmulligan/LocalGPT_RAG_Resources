Forests provide endless learning opportunities, and are great places to inspire creativity. Take your class for a visit to your local forest, and collect materials to make wonderful pieces of natural art.\n\nCurriculum links Art: (KS1) Using a range of materials creatively; Using sculpture to develop and share ideas and imagination; Using colour, pattern, texture, shape and form in the development of artworks. (KS2) Improve mastery of art and design techniques including drawing and sculpture.\n\nScience: (KS1 & KS2) Plants and animals; Everyday materials; Seasonal changes.\n\nBefore your visit Ask the children to draw a picture of what they think the forest will be like. Invite older children to add a sentence about the different kinds of natural materials that they would expect to find in the forest. How would this vary according to the time of year?\n\nFor a great in",
