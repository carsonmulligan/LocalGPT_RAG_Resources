Wars are not won by machines and weapons but by the soldiers who use them. Even the best equipped army cannot win without motivated and well-trained soldiers. If the US Army is to win the next war, its soldiers must be motivated by inspired leadership, and they must know how to do their jobs and survive on the battlefield.\n\nThis is the soldier\u2019s field manual. It tells the soldier how to perform the combat skills needed to survive on the battlefield. These are basic skills that must be learned by soldiers in all military occupational specialties (MOS).\n\nUsers of this manual may submit recommended changes or comments, referring to the page and line(s) of the text.

Do this in two steps:\n\nStep 1. Make a quick, overall search of the entire sector for obvious tar- gets and unnatural colors, outlines, or movements. Look first at the area just in front of your position, and then quickly scan the entire area out to the maximum range you want to observe. If the sector is wide, divide it and search each subsector as in Step 2.\n\nStep 2. Observe overlapping, 50-meter- wide strips, alternating from left to right and right to left, until you have searched the entire sector. When you see a suspicious spot, search it well.\n\nNIGHT OBSERVATION",

Beyond 500 meters, pick a point halfway to the target, count the number of 100-meter lengths to the halfway point, and then double that number to get the range to the target.\n\nSloping ground changes the appearance of l00-meter lengths. Ground that slopes upward makes them look longer than 100 meters, and ground that slopes downward makes them look shorter than 100 meters. Thus, the tendency is to underestimate 100-meter lengths on upslopes and overestimate them on downslopes.\n\nThe accuracy of the 100-meter method depends on how much ground is visible. This is most true at long ranges. If a target is at a range of 500 meters or more, and you can only see part of the ground between yourself and the target, it is hard to use this method with accuracy.\n\nAPPEARANCE-OF-OBJECTS METHOD (DAYTIME)\n\nThis method is a way to estimate range by the apparent size and detail of an object.

Each has its own capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Those you can use are described in this section.\n\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\n\nRadios are a frequently used means of communications. Radios are particularly suited for use when you are on the move and need a means of maintaining command and control. Small handheld or backpacked radios that com- municate for only short distances are found at squad and platoon level. As the need grows to talk over greater distances and to more units, the size and complexity of radios are increased.\n\n7-2\n\nTo put these radios to good use, you must first look at some of the things that affect radio communications.

Squelch settings on the radios must also be used correctly.\n\nFactors that affect the range of radio equipment are weather, terrain, antenna, power, and the location of the radio. Trying to commu- nicate near man-made objects such as bridges and buildings may also affect radio transmis-\n\nsions. Interference in the form of static often occurs when you use radios near powerlines or electrical generators.

Each time you talk over a radio, the sound of your voice travels in all directions. The enemy can listen to your radio transmis- sions while you are communicating with other friendly radio stations.

Although installing a wire network takes more time than installing a radio, wire lines are usually more secure than radio.

Lay overhead lines near command posts, in assembly areas, and along roads where heavy vehicular traffic may drive off the road. Also, lay them at road crossings where trenches cannot be dug, if culverts or bridges are not available.

Fear makes the pupils of your eyes enlarge, which increases your field of vision so you can detect movement more easily. Fear also increases your rate of breathing and heartbeat. That increases your strength. Therefore, control your fear and use it to your advantage.\n\nDo not let your imagination and fear run wild. Remember, you are not alone. You are part of a team.

There are other soldiers nearby, even though they cannot always be seen. Everyone must help each other and depend on each other.\n\nWorry undermines the body, dulls the mind, and slows down thinking and learning. It adds to confusion, magnifies troubles, and causes you to imagine things which really do not exist. If you are worried about something, talk to your leader about it. He may be able to help solve the problem.\n\nYou may have to fight in any part of the world and in all types of terrain. Therefore, adjust your mind to accept conditions as they are. If mentally prepared for it, you should be able to fight under almost any conditions.\n\nRULES FOR AVOIDING ILLNESS IN THE FIELD\n\nDon\u2019t consume foods and beverages from unauthorized sources.\n\nDon\u2019t soil the ground with urine or feces.

Divide this burning time by 3 to find the burning time of 30.5 cm (1 ft) of fuse. Next, determine the time it takes to reach a safe distance from the explosion. Now divide the time re- quired to reach that distance by the burn time of 30.5 cm (1 ft) of fuse. This will give the number of centimeters (ft) of fuse needed. STEP 4. Inspect the nonelectric blast- ing cap to make sure it is clear of foreign matter. STEP 5. Gently slip the blasting cap over the fuse so that the flash charge in the cap is in contact with the end of the time fuse. DO NOT FORCE THE FUSE INTO THE CAP. STEP 6.

When a foot displaces soft, moist soil to form a print, the moisture holds the edges of the print intact and sharp.

Study this process carefully to estimate the age of a print. If particles are just beginning to fall into a print, it is probably fresh.

The term \u201cimmediate use intelligence\u201d includes infor- mation of the enemy that can be put to use at once to gain surprise, to keep the enemy off balance, or to keep him from escaping an area. A commander has many sources of intelligence. He puts the information from those sources together to help determine where an enemy is, what he may be planning, and where he may be going.\n\nInformation you report gives your leader definite information on which he can act at once. For example, you may report that your leader is 30 minutes behind an enemy unit, that the enemy is moving north, and that he is now at a certain place. That gives your leader infor- mation on which he can act at once. He could then have you keep on tracking and move another unit to attack the enemy. If a trail is\n\nFM 21-75\n\nfound that has signs of recent enemy activity, your leader can set up an ambush on it.\n\nTRACKI",

The lead team of a moving unit can be a tracking team, or a separate unit may be a tracking team. There are many ways to organize such teams, and they can be any size. There should, however, be a leader, one or more trackers, and security for the trackers. A typical organization has three trackers, three security men, and a team leader with a radiotelephone operator (RATELO).\n\nWhen a team is moving, the best tracker should be in the lead, followed by his security. The two other trackers should be on the flanks, each one followed and overmatched by his security. The leader should be where he can best control the team.

The team can track visually, and the dog and handler can follow. If the team loses the signs, then the dog can take over.

If this is not the direction that you want to go, change direction again about 50 meters away using the same technique.

Range cards for 90-mm RCLR, 106-mm RCLR, Dragon, and TOW are all prepared the same. By using a range card, you can quickly and accurately determine the information needed to engage targets in your assigned sector. Before you prepare a range card, your leader will show you where to position your weapon so you can best cover your assigned sector of fire. He will then, again, point out the terrain you are to cover. He will do this by assigning you a sector of fire or by assigning left or right limits indicated by either terrain features or azimuths. If necessary, he may also assign you more than one sector of fire and will designate the sectors as primary and secondary.\n\nPREPARATION OF THE RANGE CARD\n\nOnce you have all the necessary informa- tion, you can b",
