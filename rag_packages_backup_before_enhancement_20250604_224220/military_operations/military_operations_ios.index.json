It reflected military working dog (MWD) doctrine developed during the Vietnam era. Although useful at that time, much of the information has since become obsolete. Today, MWD teams are employed in dynamic ways never before imagined.\n\nToday's MWD team is a highly deployable capability that commanders have used around the world from Afghanistan to Africa and from the Balkans to Iraq. These specialized teams aid commanders in stability and support operations as well as in warfighting. Being modular and mobile makes these teams very agile.

Their versatility allows for effective transformation at all echelons among readiness for deployment and operations on the ground, through redeployment and back to readiness.\n\nThe highly aggressive dog tactics of the 1960s and 1970s are long gone. Today's MWD program effectively employs expertly trained and motivated handlers coupled with highly intelligent breeds of dogs. These teams are continuously rotating between their assigned duties and deployments worldwide to perform joint operations, multiechelon tasks, and interagency missions.\n\nThis FM addresses the current capabilities of the Military Police Working Dog Program as well as the potential for future applications.

MWDs provide a valuable asset to military police, infantry, special forces, the Department of Defense (DOD), and other government agencies. The MWD's senses of sight, smell, and hearing enhance his detection capabilities and provide commanders with a physical and psychological deterrent to criminal activity. Properly trained MWDs can prevent an intruder or suspect from escaping. When necessary, the MWD provides an added dimension of physical force as an alternative to the use of deadly force. Public knowledge of MWD team capabilities provides military police and various security forces with a formidable deterrent wherever the MWD team is employed.\n\n1-2.

They have been heroes, showing bravery under fire, saving lives (often losing their own), and bringing comfort to the injured and infirmed. The first recorded American use of military dogs was during the Seminole War of 1835 and again in 1842. In Florida and Louisiana, the Army used Cuban bred bloodhounds for tracking. During the US Civil War, dogs were used as messengers, guards, and unit mascots.\n\n1-5. The Army Quartermaster Corps began the US Armed Forces' first war dog training during World War II. By 1945, they had trained almost 10,000 war dogs for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Fifteen war dog platoons served overseas in World War II. Seven platoons saw service in Europe and eight in the Pacific.\n\n1-6.

The following chapter addresses some fundamental areas. It is important to consult with the Staff Judge Advocate whenever legal questions pertaining to an MWD arise.\n\nUSE OF FORCE\n\n4-1. Procedures for the use of force are found in AR 190\u201314. This regulation states that personnel engaged in law enforcement or security duties will use the minimum amount of force necessary to control the situation. This regulation further details the levels of force and encourages commanders to substitute nonlethal measures for firearms when they are considered adequate for safely performing force protection, antiterrorism, and law and order functions. The regulation states that in evaluating the degree of force required for specific situations, the following options should be considered in the order listed:\n\nz Verbal persuasion. z Unarmed defens",

Although high in the order of measures, it is clear that the release of the MWD as a use of force is a nonlethal option to be used before deadly force is considered. It must be understood that the release of an MWD to pursue, bite, and hold a person is likely to result in an injury to the suspect. This injury can be very minor such as scratches or bruises; however, serious bodily harm is possible. For this reason, it is required by AR 190-14 that all lesser means of force must be used first whenever possible.\n\n4-3. The use of force differs between MWD handlers and regular military pol",

Positive control of the MWD must be maintained at all times throughout all of the use-of-force measures. Often, just the presence or arrival of a handler with his MWD can control a situation. If the desired level of control is not achieved, verbal persuasion is the first degree of force to be used.

In forward deployed areas or hostile environments, PEDD teams are often requested to ensure that any suspected explosives are detected before harm can come to US Army, joint, and allied forces. In peacetime environments around the world, PEDD teams perform the detection operations much the same as in combat support operations. The environment surrounding explosive detection operations does not interfere with the explosive detection capabilities of the PEDD team.\n\nSUSPICIOUS/UNATTENDED PACKAGE RESPONSES\n\n7-14. Once a suspicious/unattended item that may contain explosives has been discovered, the military police or security forces on the scene request a PEDD team. Normally, military police evacuate the area and establish a CP a safe distance away from the threat using the stand-off distance listed in Appendix I of this manual. The PEDD team checks the perimeter and secures the area for se",

Bleeding must be quickly controlled, particularly wounds in the foot or leg that are prone to bleed freely. Applying pressure directly on the wound may control bleeding; use a sterile bandage or clean handkerchief or pinch the edges of the wound with your fingers. As soon as possible, apply a pressure bandage.\n\nBURNS\n\n8-41. Most burns occur when an animal comes into contact with hot water, grease, tar, or other scalding liquids.

Just as the environment affects soldiers performing their duties, the MWD is affected by his surroundings. It is important for planners and leaders to become aware of the many different conditions that can affect the performance of MWDs. Not all MWDs are affected in the same manner. Acclimation times will vary between conditions and MWDs. Planning considerations should always include the VCO when the MWD will be used or trained in environments that he is not accustomed to.\n\nWIND\n\n8-61.

The plan for the indoor or outdoor kennel (Figure B-10, page B-13) is the same for either style. The obvious difference is the wall that encloses the kennels. For indoor kennels, the exterior walls along the runs should have windows beginning at 6 feet above the finished floor to allow for natural light. Windows should be operable and hinged at the sill to tilt inward to prevent the escape of MWDs. For outdoor kennels, the exterior wall is simply an 8-foot chain-link fence. Water faucets with hot and cold water are required at each corner of the building. These are required to clean the gutter and drain system (Figure B-11, page B-13) for the kennel. A gutter and drainage system is provided at the back of the kennel run for either type of kennel for sluicing wastewaters from cleaning operations. Kennel run floors should slope to the gutter and the gutter should slope to the drain. Gutters shoul",
