Why You Should Choose
a Solar System
Over the past five years, the cost of installing a solar system has
gone down significantly. Now, solar energy can power a home
throughout the day and greatly reduce how much a family spends
on energy each year.
Those who don’t take advantage of the natural energy of the
sun will always pay for their electricity. Paying for electricity never
goes away, no matter how much or little you use.
By harnessing the power of solar energy, you own a major part of
the power you use. Choosing a solar system is an investment that
immediately begins to pay for itself through the savings you get
from relying on a renewable energy source for power.
Many homeowners pay off their investment in five to six years
as a result of savings realized through solar (though results may
vary).
Installing LG Solar’s high-efficiency panels on your home helps
you benefit from the sun’s love and create a better relationship
with energy consumption needs.
To help you select and install your solar system, an independent
local installer, or LG PRO Installer trained by LG, will visit your
home to assess its solar potential. You can find an LG PRO who
will supply a free detailed quote by getting started at:

The Benefits of 01
S O L A R P O W E R C A N
S A V E Y O U M O N E Y
Solar Energy
Installing solar panels enables you to generate your own electricity rather than
buying it from your electric company. This enables you to save money as every
kW/h of electricity you use from your solar system is a kW/h of electricity you do
not have to buy from your electric company.
02
E N V I R O N M E N T A L
B E N E F I T S
By using electricity generated from the sun’s love, we reduce the need to produce
electricity from fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which create carbon dioxide
(CO2). This can reduce the potential for global warming and create a more
sustainable and cleaner energy mix.
03
E N E R G Y
I N D E P E N D E N C E
With your own solar system, you can embrace the sun and the energy it is able to
generate. This reduces your reliance on fossil fuels while increasing your control
over your future electricity needs, expenses and lifestyle. If you add an energy
storage system to your solar array, you gain even more control over your energy
usage and costs.
04
E N E R G Y
R E L I A B I L I T Y
High-quality solar systems are a reliable power source. The sun rises and sets
every day, and when the sun shines, solar panels generate electricity. While the
weather and seasons vary, the amount of electricity that solar panels generate is
predictable, and you can plan accordingly to get all the love from the sun you need
to power your home. LG Solar’s high-efficiency panels are designed to capture
more of the sun, more of the time too, which helps expand how you power your
home. You can also increase the financial benefits of your solar system by changing
the times you operate your household appliances. For example, turning your
washing machine on as you leave home in the morning instead of washing your
clothes at night will avoid the higher electricity rates charged by some utilities
during peak usage times. If you install an energy storage system, you can use the
energy stored from your solar system during those times.

How a Grid System Works
A solar system is made up of multiple solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, a DC to AC power converter (inverter
solution) and a framing system to hold the solar panels in place.
Solar panels are generally fitted on the roof facing a southern, easterly or westerly direction.

connected solar panels. Unless you add storage batteries to your system, a grid-connected solar
system is unable to store power in your home for use at night.
There is also a third possible inverter solution - power optimizers.
These are a variance of the string inverter and the micro inverter.
Once you’re in the process of getting your solar system, ask your
authorized LG PRO Installer for advice on which of these inverter
solutions is the most suitable for you. Quality inverter/micro inverter
solutions include Fronius, SMA, SolarEdge and Enphase brands.

How Solar Systems Make A Little Love
From the Sun Go A Long Way
A solar system is made up of several key components, all of which combine to generate electricity, regulate and
control the flow of the electricity and to connect and mount the solar system to your home. A grid-connected solar
system is comprised of panels, a string inverter or micro-inverters or optimizers, a roof mounting system and electrical
accessories including circuit breakers and wires. It is important that all components work together, with no component
compromising the performance, safety or life expectancy of any other component.
S O L A R P A N E L S
Solar panels on roofs of homes
generate clean energy by converting
sunlight into usable electricity. This
conversion takes place within the solar
cells and is a process that requires no 325 to 340W 350 to 365W
moving parts.
I N V E R T E R S O L U T I O N S
A solar inverter is one of the most important elements
of the solar system. It converts the variable direct
current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel
into a 240V alternating current (AC). This AC electricity
can be fed into your home to operate your household
appliances.
Depending on how your system is set up, the electricity
that is not used in your home is either fed into the grid
via a digital meter or stored in home batteries for later
use. New hybrid inverters now include an integrated
battery management system. The appropriate solar
system inverters are based on several factors, such as
your location and the local climate. Your LG PRO Installer
will be able to give you information on the best long-
lasting configuration for your home.
7

M O U N T I N G S Y S T E M S
Solar systems are mounted to roofs with a mounting system
using various railings, frames and tiles or tin feet. Most mounting
systems are made of aluminum with stainless steel hardware and
are designed to accept a variety of solar modules on a variety of roof
types. Aluminum rails with clamps attach the solar panels to the rail
and connection brackets fix the rail to the roof (see diagram below).
Superior mounting systems are manufactured with higher grades of
aluminum and stainless steel, often resulting in less weight on the
roof and lower levels of corrosion over longer periods of time. Quality
mounting rails may also feature robust anchoring points and design
solutions that speed up the installation time of your solar system.
CLIP MOUNTING
i
Metering Your Solar System
There are two fundamental steps to take when
connecting your solar system to the grid.
Your electric company will specify what type of meter is
required to measure your solar generation and energy
consumption. Your LG PRO Installer will be able to
explain the details to you. You may be required to pay
for the cost of the new solar meter, its installation and
the cost of your solar system. Prices for the meter can
be a few hundred dollars, so you should make sure that
the solar electricity meter supply and the connection are
included in the quote for your new solar system.

Installing Solar Panels for
Your Solar System
T I L T I N G A N D O R I E N T A T I O N
Solar modules can face anywhere from the East to the South and the i Shading
West, while still providing good output performance.
Depending on your location in the U.S., your grid-connected LG solar
system will generate the most solar electricity when the panels are
facing south at the right angle. The best angle can greatly increase the
connection between the sun’s energy and your home, which helps to
build an even greater sense of energy independence.
Discuss your electricity usage with your LG PRO Installer so that your
usage pattern can be matched with your solar panels’ installation. Of
course, the orientation, shape and size of your roof also play a major role
in where the panels can be installed.
D A I L Y R O U T I N E
The amount of electricity generated by your
solar system directly relates to the amount of
sunlight that your solar panels receive. If your
solar modules are in the shade, the system will
generate less electricity.
Even a single antenna or a chimney shadow
on your panels can affect performance, while
the overall effectiveness of your solar system
is dependent on where you live. In some areas
of the U.S., tree coverage greatly reduces the
effectiveness of solar panels. Using micro-
inverters or power optimizers on each panel
instead of one large string inverter (where
multiple panels are connected to one inverter)
can help with shadow issues. If you believe that
Thinking about your daily routine and your electricity consumption will you may have a shade issue, talk to your LG

the day, a south-facing roof is more ideal. On the other hand, if lots of
electricity is used in the early and late afternoon, a south-west facing
roof is more likely to offer the best outcome. With multi-string inverters,
you can also put one group of solar panels (one string) on the east and
one on the west to cover a wider timespan.
9

M O U N T I N G
If a suitable roof area is not available at your home, LG solar panels
can be fitted to a ground-mounted system in a sun-filled spot on your
land. However, you will need to allow for additional costs for a ground
mounting system and costs for running the cable safely in the ground.
These options can be discussed with your local LG PRO Installer.
I N S T A L L I N G P A N E L S F O R LG is confident that our panels will give you years of reliable functionality
and an even greater appreciation for solar energy. Although the
G R E A T E R P E R F O R M A N C E
cables, safety devices and mounting systems are less influential to the
performance of your solar system, the use of poor-quality cables or
isolators can lead to an early ending to your new-found relationship
with the sun. In cases where non-branded plugs and cables were used,
complete system failures have occurred.
For a decade of low maintenance to your solar system, it is strongly
suggested that you purchase high-quality solar panels and quality solar
inverters, and ask for high-quality system components in all aspects of
your solar system.
Some inexpensive solar panels have failed in certain climates in as little as
24 months. Some issues have been water ingress, corrosion, hot-spots,
failed bypass diodes or junction box failures. These types of failures lead
to the write-off of the panel. Lengthy promised warranties are hard
to claim if dealers, installers or panel manufacturers have gone into
liquidation or have stopped operating.
10

How Many Panels Does
Your Solar System Need?
An LG PRO Installer will visit your home for a site inspection to check
the roof position, discuss your electricity usage pattern, suggest
monitor options and, where applicable, conduct a shade analysis to
ensure that the right quantity of the most suitable panels is placed
in the optimum position. Buyers should insist that their installer also
undertake a physical site inspection.
An installer’s willingness to visit your home gives some indication of
the quality of service you will receive for your purchase. As a result, we
advise that you buy your solar system from a local installer and not an
Internet-based solar sales agent.
Historically (when Internet solar sales were rapidly increasing),
consumers purchased solar systems without site inspections.
Sometimes this resulted in their installer highlighting the need for
special roof brackets or a total switchboard upgrade before the solar
system could be installed. These additions added unexpected costs and
time delays to the installation.
Before making your purchase decision, find out who your point of
contact will be if you have questions after the installation. Make sure
that you ask for a comprehensive written warranty from your LG PRO
Installer for the cabling and installation work, not just the panels,
inverter and mounting frame.
How Long Do Solar Systems Last?
The key components susceptible to failure in your solar system are the solar panels,
the inverter and some components such as fuses and isolators.
LG solar products tend to have longer life cycles as they undertake more quality
control steps, use higher quality cells and solders, have stronger UV protection
on backing sheets and ensure the water sealing of panels withstands decades of
weather-induced deterioration. Very low-cost panels with less UV-stabilized backing
sheets, cheaper sealants and more fragile framing can deteriorate faster, and can fail in
as little as 2-4 years.
Unfortunately, sometimes lengthy warranties on cheaper products have been
unobtainable, as both manufacturers and installers have avoided liability by going out
of business.
The key warranties to investigate are for performance, product and labor. These cover
the power output of the panel, a replacement panel and its transport in the case
of a panel failure and the labor costs involved in replacing a panel. Cheaper panels
often do not cover transport and replacement labor. Make sure you verify with your
installer what is covered in the warranty and ask for the detailed warranty document.
LG NeON® 2 and LG NeON® R panels are backed by a 25-year warranty that covers
performance, product and labor (Labor costs in the rare case of a needed module
repair or replacement are covered up to $450.)

Government incentives may be available for your solar system. Over
the years, these incentives have changed, and they are likely to
change in the future. Talk to your LG PRO Installer to get the updated
information you need about the latest incentives applicable to you.
U.S. incentives vary greatly based on a homeowner’s location. Many
great programs are available for people on the local, state and federal
level. In order to find out what types of incentives are available to you,
LG will connect you with a local LG PRO Installer who can walk you
through your options.

Details on How
to Choose a
Solar Company
It is recommended that consumers use a reputable installer who
checks your specific solar system requirements and ensures the
connection between the sun and your home is strong. Please see
the points below regarding the advantages of using a company
promoting high-quality products.
01
A reputable solar retail company is more likely to
fully evaluate your requirements and explain in
detail what needs to be done in order to install
your solar system.
02
A local diversified company is more likely to be
around in the future to service any warranty
issues or system upgrades. As we’ve shared in
this educational piece, some solar installers and
dealers make big promises, but then vanish.
03
If your installer is selling you LG solar panels, then
LG is more than likely to service your panels in
the future through your local LG PRO Installer.
If you choose an unknown brand, again, the
manufacturer may go out of business, or the
importer may stop importing these panels into
the U.S. A safe option is to buy branded solar
panels from diversified manufacturers such as LG
that have a proven track record. After all, the sun
loves LG and knows the company’s decades of
innovation mean it’s going to be here when you
need it to be.
04
A reputable solar company will be fully aware of
current electricity supply rules and will provide
advice on the best system for your needs and
location. Well-established businesses will be more
likely to give you the most up-to-date advice.
05
If your local installer is aligned with LG, then he/
she must install the solar power system to a high
standard and act ethically in all business dealings
with you, the customer.

Important
What you should know about the 25-year
Performance Warranty
Over time, all solar panels will show degradation and produce
less electricity. In order to give buyers some guidance about the
level of expected degradation, a warranty is offered by most
manufacturers. This warranty lasts, in most cases, for 25 years
and guarantees, for conventional panels, an output of around
80% of the original capacity. LG guarantees up to 90.08%
efficiency for the NeON® 2 and the LG NeON® R guarantees up
to 90.8% efficiency with a 25-year performance warranty.
Unfortunately, this warranty can easily cause confusion. Please
note that an output warranty IS NOT a performance warranty. An
output warranty only covers a portion of the costs for replacing
your solar panels and only if your panel is in working order. On the
other hand, a performance warranty covers all costs of replacing
a faulty solar panel with a new one.
In many sales promotions, the 25-Year warranty is highlighted,
but when it comes to an output warranty, you will have to pay for
removing panels from the roof, shipping the panels for testing,
the return, and reinstallation.
Output warranties don’t cover the full cost of replacing a panel,
especially when the customer has to spend many hundreds of
dollars on install/uninstall costs.. Be aware of glossy 25-Year
warranty stickers – it is the performance warranty that counts
toward getting the most out of your investment in using solar
energy to strengthen your relationship with the sun.
