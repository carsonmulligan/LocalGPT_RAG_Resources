Preface
The last Army dog field manual (FM) was published in 1977. It reflected military working dog (MWD)
doctrine developed during the Vietnam era. Although useful at that time, much of the information has since
become obsolete. Today, MWD teams are employed in dynamic ways never before imagined.
Today's MWD team is a highly deployable capability that commanders have used around the world from
Afghanistan to Africa and from the Balkans to Iraq. These specialized teams aid commanders in stability and
support operations as well as in warfighting. Being modular and mobile makes these teams very agile. As
situations dictate, MWD teams are quick to arrive and able to conduct various operations. Their versatility
allows for effective transformation at all echelons among readiness for deployment and operations on the
ground, through redeployment and back to readiness.
The highly aggressive dog tactics of the 1960s and 1970s are long gone. Today's MWD program effectively
employs expertly trained and motivated handlers coupled with highly intelligent breeds of dogs. These teams
are continuously rotating between their assigned duties and deployments worldwide to perform joint operations,
multiechelon tasks, and interagency missions.
This FM addresses the current capabilities of the Military Police Working Dog Program as well as the potential
for future applications. As technology and world situations change, the MWD team will continue the
transformation process and give commanders the full-spectrum capabilities needed to be combat multipliers on
the battlefield as well as persuasive force protection and antiterrorism assets.
Appendix A complies with current Army directives, which state that the metric system will be incorporated into
all new publications.
This publication applies to the Active Army, the Army National Guard (ARNG)/the Army National Guard of
the United States (ARNGUS), and the United States Army Reserve (USAR).

Chapter 1
The Military Working Dog Program
Dogs have been used for the protection of life and property since ancient times. From
these beginnings, dog training and employment has been continuously refined to
produce a highly sophisticated and versatile extension of the soldier's own senses.
Even the most complex machines remain unable to duplicate the operational
effectiveness of a properly trained MWD team.
THE ROLE OF THE MILITARY WORKING DOG
1-1. MWDs provide a valuable asset to military police, infantry, special forces, the Department of
Defense (DOD), and other government agencies. The MWD's senses of sight, smell, and hearing enhance
his detection capabilities and provide commanders with a physical and psychological deterrent to criminal
activity. Properly trained MWDs can prevent an intruder or suspect from escaping. When necessary, the
MWD provides an added dimension of physical force as an alternative to the use of deadly force. Public
knowledge of MWD team capabilities provides military police and various security forces with a
formidable deterrent wherever the MWD team is employed.
1-2. MWDs are key resources for use in the military police combat support role. MWDs are trained for
scouting, patrolling, and performing building and area searches. Commanders can use Table 1-1 to
determine what MWD type best suits their needs. Some MWDs have also been trained to track although
this is not a required area of expertise. All of these skills contribute to the successful completion of the five
military police functions across the full spectrum of military operations.

1 PEDDs will not be used to provide security in ASPs, as the ammunition and explosives contained at
the ASP will detract from the MWD's detection ability and may distract the MWD from his patrol
function.
2 MWDs will not be used in a correction/detention facility to ensure custody of prisoners.
3 PEDDs can be used to search the area around a suspicious/unattended package for secondary
devices. At no time will a PEDD or handler be used to search the package itself.
4 Direct confrontation with demonstrators is not recommended, but is authorized with the commander's
approval when lesser means of force have been unsuccessful.
1-3. MWDs are a unique item; they are the only living item in the Army supply system. Like other highly
specialized equipment, MWDs complement and enhance the capabilities of the military police. MWD
teams enable the military police to perform its mission more effectively and with significant savings of
manpower, time, and money.
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE MILITARY WORKING DOG
1-4. Dogs have served in active service at the sides of their handlers for decades. They have been heroes,
showing bravery under fire, saving lives (often losing their own), and bringing comfort to the injured and
infirmed. The first recorded American use of military dogs was during the Seminole War of 1835 and
again in 1842. In Florida and Louisiana, the Army used Cuban bred bloodhounds for tracking. During the
US Civil War, dogs were used as messengers, guards, and unit mascots.
1-5. The Army Quartermaster Corps began the US Armed Forces' first war dog training during World
War II. By 1945, they had trained almost 10,000 war dogs for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast
Guard. Fifteen war dog platoons served overseas in World War II. Seven platoons saw service in Europe
and eight in the Pacific.
1-6. MWDs were trained at Fort Carson, Colorado, organized into scout dog platoons, and used in the
Korean conflict for sentry duty and support of combat patrols. In 1957, MWD training moved to Lackland
Air Force base (LAFB), Texas, with the Air Force managing the program.
1-7. Throughout the Vietnam Conflict, the Military Police Corps used dogs with considerable success.
Most of these were sentry dogs used to safeguard critical installations such as ports and airfields. A new
dimension in canine utilization was realized when marijuana detector dog teams were trained and deployed
to assist military police in suppressing illicit drug traffic. Sentry and marijuana detector dog teams were
then deployed worldwide in support of military police. An important outgrowth of the conflict was the
development of canine research and development efforts. These ongoing efforts were able to initiate the
first steps toward developing a more intelligent and stronger military dog, training dogs to detect specific
drugs and explosives, developing multiple-purpose dogs, and employing tactical dogs by electronic remote
control.
1-8. In the 1990s and early 2000s, MWDs were deployed around the globe in military operations such as
Just Cause, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Uphold Democracy, and Enduring Freedom and Iraqi
Freedom. These teams were effectively utilized to enhance the security of critical facilities and areas, as
well as bolster force protection and antiterrorism missions, allowing commanders to use military police

The Military Working Dog Program
soldiers and other assets more effectively elsewhere. MWD operations in Haiti showed the first large-scale
utilization of MWDs since Vietnam. In the Balkans, military police deployed with MWDs to provide force
protection and antiterrorism support and area security throughout the US base camps. MWDs trained as
explosive detector dogs conducted vehicle sweeps and building searches to ensure the safety of US
soldiers. US Army MWD teams operated beside Iraqi police officials to help in law and order missions and
restore the war torn country into a peaceful region.
1-9. MWDs are force multipliers. Installation commanders should include MWDs when planning for
force protection and antiterrorism countermeasures. They expand the individual soldier's effectiveness in
the face of those that would come against him. They provide an immense physical and psychological effect
when used as a show of force in day-to-day operations. The various uses of MWDs have been effectively
employed in many aspects of military police missions. MWDs are utilized effectively at gates, camps and
bases, and checkpoints and for random searches for narcotics and explosive devices. MWDs are also
utilized for other missions in support of combat, combat support, and combat service support units.
1-10. MWD teams are assigned to perform high-risk personnel (HRP) security missions. MWD teams
perform narcotic detection missions on the Mexico and US border to assist US Customs. They have been
deployed on the United States and Canada border to perform law and order operations. The canine can
easily detect what his handler cannot see, hear, or smell. The MWD's controllable aggressive behavior,
coupled with the physical and psychological effects he creates, makes him and his handler an impressive
and unmatchable team.
ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF MILITARY WORKING DOG
UNITS
1-11. The US Army MWD program is an organization with structure and responsibilities that reach from
the DOD level down to the handler level. For information concerning organization and responsibilities
above the local level, see Army Regulation (AR) 190-12.
KENNEL MASTER TEAM
1-12. The kennel master (KM) team is comprised of two noncommissioned officers (NCOs) (one sergeant
first class [SFC], who is the KM and one staff sergeant [SSG], who is the plans NCO). The KM team is
modular and provides technical supervision of MWD teams assigned to the military police brigade. This
team may be assigned to the corps military police brigade, echelon above corps (EAC) military police
brigade, or the internment and resettlement (I/R) brigade. In addition to technical supervision, this team
plans and coordinates MWD operations and support requirements. The KM team is also responsible for
MWD team proficiency training. This team supervises the storage and accountability of the narcotic and
explosive training aids as well as all assigned equipment.
PATROL EXPLOSIVE DETECTOR DOG TEAM
1-13. The patrol explosive detector dog (PEDD) team is comprised of three NCO MWD handlers (one
SSG, and two sergeants [SGTs]) and three PEDDs. This team detects explosives and contraband in support
of combat, combat support, and combat service support units and the five military police functions. It
provides MWD patrol support (including I/R operations) when not employed with explosive detection.
This team is normally assigned to the corps military police brigade, EAC military police brigade, military
police I/R brigade, or the I/R command and control (C2) detachment. This entire modular team can be
deployed together as a unit with all assigned equipment or, based on the specific mission, a handler and an
assigned MWD may be deployed apart from the team.
PATROL NARCOTIC DETECTOR DOG TEAM
1-14. The patrol narcotic detector dog (PNDD) team is comprised of three NCO MWD handlers (one SGT
and two specialists [SPC]) and three PNDDs. This team detects narcotics and other drugs in support of
combat, combat support, and combat service support units and the five military police functions. It

provides MWD patrol support (including I/R operations) when not employed with narcotics detection. This
team is normally assigned to the corps military police brigade, EAC military police brigade, military police
I/R brigade, or the I/R C2 detachment. This entire modular team can be deployed together as a unit with all
assigned equipment or, based on the specific mission, a handler and an assigned MWD can be deployed
apart from the team.
INDIVIDUAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
1-15. There are five levels of responsibility in the MWD program. The terminal level is the program
manager and the beginning level, the handler. This is not to be confused with the operational chain of
command or standards of grade. These individuals have specific duties in managing and performing the
MWD program.
PROGRAM MANAGER
1-16. The program manager executes major Army command (MACOM) level responsibilities for the
MWD program. He is the equivalent of an operations NCO and is an appointed certification authority
whose duties include—
z Conducting MWD team patrol and detector certifications.
z Requisitioning personnel and MWDs.
z Providing policy and guidelines for the MACOM.
z Forecasting annual operational budgets.
z Coordinating MWD support for the office of the Secretary of Defense, US Secret Service
(USSS), US Customs Service (USCS), and Department of State missions.
z Serving as the MACOM provost marshal's (PM's) advisor for the employment of MWDs in
contingency operations, force protection and antiterrorism support, and homeland defense.
KENNEL MASTER
1-17. The KM is the senior NCO in charge of the installation's MWD program, consisting of 6 to 30
handlers and respective MWDs. KM duties are the equivalent of a platoon sergeant's duties when 9 or
more handlers and MWDs are assigned. When 8 or fewer handlers and MWDs are assigned, the duties are
equal to those of a squad leader. In addition to traditional leadership responsibilities, KM duties include—
z Monitoring all training to ensure that MWD teams are ready for annual certifications and
worldwide deployments in support of various operational missions.
z Advising the commander on the employment of MWD teams.
z Ensuring that team proficiency is maintained.
z Preparing for MACOM and veterinary inspections.
z Forecasting annual operational budgets.
z Assisting the MACOM program manager in requisitioning personnel, MWDs, and equipment.
z Managing the daily maintenance and upkeep of kennel facilities.
z Monitoring MWDs' health and welfare.
z Managing procurements and accounts for explosive and narcotic training aids.
z Advising installation and unit force protection and antiterrorism officers on the use of MWDs.
z Coordinating MWD support for the USSS, the USCS, DOD protective services units, combat
support operations, the Army Recruiting Command, and other civilian agencies.
1-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

The Military Working Dog Program
MILITARY WORKING DOG PLANS NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER
1-18. The MWD plans NCO is part of the KM team and performs the duties of the maneuver mobility
support operations (MMSO) and training NCOs. The plans NCO is selected for his ability and overall
knowledge of training, mentoring, and deploying MWD assets. This NCO is responsible for―
z Developing training plans.
z Coordinating and planning the unit mission-essential task list (METL).
z Supervising the execution and tracking of the deployment plan.
z Tracking the movement of MWD teams while they are deployed.
z Ensuring that deployed soldier's issues are resolved.
z Assisting in the supervision of the installation MWD program.
z Acting as the KM when the KM is absent.
z Preparing short- and long-term training outlines and risk assessments.
z Validating and supervising proficiency training.
z Overwatching preparation for the deployment of MWD teams.
SENIOR MILITARY WORKING DOG HANDLER
1-19. The senior MWD handler is the senior NCO of the PEDD or PNDD teams. His duties are the
equivalent of the squad leader of the PEDD team or the team leader of the PNDD team. In addition to
traditional leadership responsibilities, he is responsible for ensuring that—
z Annual certification training is conducted.
z MWD teams are ready for deployments.
z Team proficiency is maintained.
z Handlers are proficient with their assigned MWDs.
z Coordination for MWD team support for the USSS, the USCS, combat support operations, the
Army Recruiting Command, and other civilian agencies is completed.
MILITARY WORKING DOG HANDLER
1-20. The handler provides the daily care and grooming for his assigned MWD. He ensures that
proficiency skills are maintained in his assigned MWD. The handler and MWD perform either PNDD
operations or PEDD operations. The handler and MWD are all trained for patrol but the variant for
narcotics detector or explosive detector depends on the MWD team's training. The handler also—
z Fills out training records daily.
z Grooms the assigned MWD daily.
z Trains the assigned MWD daily.
z Maintains MWD kennels daily.
z Performs additional kennels duties.
Note: For more information about additional skill identifier (ASI) Z6 standards of grade, refer to
DA Pamphlet (Pam) 611-21.
FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE USE OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS
1-21. An MWD can be trained to respond consistently to certain sensory stimuli (sights, sounds, odors, or
scents) and alert the handler. Under most circumstances, a properly trained MWD can smell, hear, and
visually detect movement better than a person.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 1-5

Chapter 1
1-22. Commanders and supervisors should consider the capabilities of the MWD team when identifying
and evaluating possible MWD employment. Not all MWD teams are able or equipped to perform all
missions equally (see Table 1-1, page 1-1).
USE OF PATROL DOGS
1-23. All MWD teams are trained to perform patrol missions. One benefit of employment is the deterrence
of criminal activity. The obvious presence and well-published activities of MWD teams can successfully
deter trespassers, vandals, violent persons, and other would-be criminals. When the desired task is to deter
unauthorized or suspicious individuals, an MWD team should be assigned to a location during day or
night.
1-24. The patrol dog's (PD's) contribution to the law and order effort is most effective when the team is
utilized as a walking patrol. The law enforcement duties that a PD team can perform as a walking patrol
include checking or clearing buildings and patrolling parking lots, family housing areas, and troop billet
areas. Mobility significantly increases the potential area of coverage. The best and most effective method is
the ride awhile, walk awhile method. This concept helps cover large patrol areas, and the periodic exercise
helps keep the team alert. All PD teams can be utilized for—
z Antiterrorism operations.
z Force protection and antiterrorism efforts.
z Special-reaction team (SRT) operations.
z Assistance in military police investigations.
z Walking and mobile patrols.
z Alarm responses.
z Building checks and searches.
z The identification and apprehension of individuals.
z The protection of HRPs.
z The protection of funds.
z Open-area searches.
z Civil disturbances.
z Perimeter security.
z External intrusion detection.
z Response forces.
z Access control points (ACPs) support.
z High-risk targets (HRT) support.
z Mission-essential vulnerable areas (MEVA) support.
z I/R operations.
1-25. Many of the tasks above can be performed in combat support or force protection and antiterrorism
operations. In addition, PD teams can and should be utilized as a tool for area defense, providing warning
and response. PD teams are effective on combat patrols and as listening posts and reconnaissance team
members. The employment of PD teams should not be overlooked during I/R or enemy prisoner of war
(EPW) operations. PDs are trained to apprehend suspects at or near a crime scene, stop those who may
attempt to escape, and protect their handlers from harm. Some PDs may be able to locate suspects who
have left the scene of a crime.
1-26. The PD team should be utilized to provide a psychological deterrent and a show of additional force
protection and antiterrorism measures. PD teams should be placed on roving patrols at ACPs, vulnerable
areas, and the location of HRP. These missions should increase as force protection and antiterrorism levels
increase.
1-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

The Military Working Dog Program
USE OF PATROL NARCOTIC DETECTOR DOGS
1-27. Military police commanders, planners, and supervisors have a very effective means of detecting the
possession and/or use of controlled substances with the employment of a PNDD team. PNDDs are trained
to recognize the scent of certain illegal substances through a program of practice and reward.
1-28. In addition to PD missions, PNDD dogs can be utilized for the following:
z Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and military police investigator drug investigations.
z USCS inspections.
z Health and welfare inspections.
z Barracks searches.
z Workplace searches.
z Random gate inspections.
z Area searches.
z Vehicle searches.
z Postal inspections.
z I/R operations.
z Aircraft and luggage searches.
z Predeployment and redeployment searches.
z Other US government agency support.
1-29. When the PNDD responds on any of the substances he is trained to detect, his handler takes the
appropriate action. PNDD teams perform a valuable service by helping to rid the military community of
illegal drugs and the problems associated with drug and controlled substance abuse.
USE OF PATROL EXPLOSIVE DETECTOR DOGS
1-30. PEDD teams are very useful in many searches or investigations involving explosives. The search for
explosives is critically important to ensure that the community is safe and protected from would-be
terrorists. PEDD teams are particularly useful if there is a need to locate one or more of these explosive
items, which may have been hidden in an area.
1-31. The deterrent value and the detection capabilities of PEDD teams are a very effective
countermeasure to terrorism. Public knowledge that PEDD teams are in use is a deterrent to persons who
may try to use explosives illegally. The knowledge that explosives can be detected by PEDD teams at entry
points or in places where explosives have been hidden can prevent a person from attempting to commit
terrorist acts.
1-32. In addition to PD missions, PEDD dogs can be utilized for—
z Bomb threat incidents.
z Suspicious/unattended package incidents.
z ACP searches.
z Checkpoint searches.
z Random gate searches.
z CID and military police investigations section.
z Health and welfare inspections.
z Building and area searches.
z Postal inspections.
z Aircraft and luggage searches.
z Predeployment and redeployment searches.
z Protective service missions.
z Other US government agency support.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 1-7

Chapter 1
1-33. A well–trained PEDD team can conduct a significantly more effective search of an area or facility in
a much shorter time than a number of people can. Using PEDD teams helps reduce the potential risk to
persons who would otherwise have to do the search without the benefit of the dog's superior sense of smell.
More detailed information concerning the employment of PD, PNDD, and PEDD teams is discussed in
Chapters 5, 6, and 7.

Chapter 2
Administrative Requirements
This chapter contains information that is useful in planning an MWD program or
adding MWD teams to an existing program. The guidelines in this section are not
meant to be absolutes for utilization, training, or maintenance. They give general
guidance and information that should be considered when planning a program.
Leaders will find the following information helpful for writing authorization
documentation statements and for planning the local MWD program. It is important
to remember that all MWDs are trained as PDs in addition to the specific type of
detector dog (narcotic or explosive).
DETERMINATION OF A NEED FOR MILITARY WORKING DOGS
2-1. The installation provost marshal (PM), military police unit commander, or task force commander
must take the initiative to establish the local MWD program if it does not already exist. The specific needs
must be determined and the costs of the program must be justified. The decision process involves a
thorough risk and crime analysis, an accurate evaluation of the requirements of the entire military police
mission, and the use of the working dog yardsticks located in this chapter.
2-2. Some of the factors to consider when determining the need for MWD teams include—
z The mission of the team.
z The size of the area of responsibility of the team.
z The size of the installation or the area population.
z The number of personnel to be served by the team.
z Incident rates for all crimes.
z The present capability and the commitment of a portion of the manpower resources as handlers.
z The types of terrain on the installation or in the probable areas of deployment.
z The types of combat support missions for which MWD teams can be used.
z The number of critical facilities or areas.
z The capabilities of each type of team.
z The number of HRP on the installation or in the area of responsibility.
VERIFICATION OF AUTHORIZATIONS
2-3. Initial MWD authorizations should be probationary using the following criteria:
z Adjustments must be made based on actual use data.
z A baseline ratio of 24 hours of MWD utilization to 8 hours training per week (4 hours patrol and
4 hours detection) must be maintained.
Utilization includes all missions (force protection/law enforcement, security, and combat

support), whether patrolling, detecting drugs or explosives, or performing other functions
(in combination), when a handler and dog are being employed together as a team.
Training includes all training activities to maintain, improve, regain, or develop dog skills

such as obedience, controlled aggression, patrolling, scouting, detection of persons, and
detection of drugs or explosives.
z An automatic review must be made by the respective MACOM after two years.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 2-1

Chapter 2
2-4. There is a trade-off when adjusting between the training and utilization necessary to reinforce basic
skills or add new skills. For example, four hours per week may be adequate to maintain detector dog
proficiency or to train in new skills, but additional training may be justified at times and training hours may
be increased accordingly. This increase in training time should be accompanied by an equivalent reduction
in utilization time. However, training hours should not be increased merely as a substitute for lack of
utilization.
MISSION REQUIREMENTS
2-5. The mission requirements for the following support missions should be considered. These
requirements should be used only as guidelines.
INSTALLATION FORCE PROTECTION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT
2-6. In order to provide continuous 24-hour, year-round MWD protection of the installation, nine MWDs
are needed. Six of these dogs will be PEDD and three will be PNDD. This requirement is based on each
MWD team being used a minimum of 24 hours per week. This does not include hours needed for training,
grooming, or health care requirements. This does allow for temporary duty (TDY), handler leave, and
illness.
2-7. The goal is to have one PEDD per installation available at all times for bomb threats or explosive
type missions (not counted as part of the working force protection requirement). Installations with a three-
or four-star headquarters require one additional PEDD authorization. This is due to the increased workload,
facility criticality, facility vulnerability, location, past history of terrorist target selections, and present
threat assessments.
HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL SECURITY MISSIONS
2-8. DOD tasks the Army to provide PEDD support for presidential, vice presidential, Secretary of State,
and Secretary of Defense visits throughout the world. Currently, there is not a published formula to
predetermine mission frequencies or requirements for these missions. On average, 40 teams inside the
MACOM support the various missions above. These figures do not include travel or mission preparation
time.
CUSTOMS SUPPORT
2-9. While no formula exists to quantify requirements for military customs support, this remains an
ongoing mission that must be viewed as a requirement for additional MWD authorizations. MWDs are
used to screen household goods shipments, privately owned vehicles (POVs), container express (CONEX)
containers, military equipment, US mail, and port operations. Workload varies by installation population,
location, unit missions and deployments, and the time of year.
CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS SUPPORT
2-10. Currently, approximately 50 MWD teams are supporting various contingency operations. This
requirement will continue until mission completion. This figure represents 25 percent of Army MWD
authorizations. Support for contingency operations has continued to rise since 1990 and will continue to do
so. This increase must be factored into planning for MWD authorizations. A conservative average of 100
MWDs is needed for contingency operations on a yearly basis. This number is to ensure that MWD teams
do not perform back-to-back deployments and that they receive proper proficiency training according to
AR 190-12 (4 hours per week in each specialty and 95 percent accuracy for PEDDs or 90 percent accuracy
for PNDDs).
2-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Administrative Requirements
KENNEL CONSTRUCTION
2-11. When new MWD programs are started at locations where there are no facilities in place, kennel
construction must be complete before the dogs arrive. The MWDs should be ordered through the military
standard transportation and issue procedures (MILSTRIP) process approximately one year before the
expected completion date of the kennel facility. In operations where MWD teams will be deployed for long
periods of time and will be rotated, a permanent facility must be constructed within one year. Deployable
field kennels may be used in the interim. The joint service MWD committee states that the DOD's design
guide for MWD facilities must be referenced in planning the construction or renovation of a kennel
facility.
2-12. Once the need and the justification for an MWD program are established, the PM, military police
commander, or task force commander initiates a request to the installation facilities engineer to develop the
kennel facility design. Before the kennel design has been finalized, the activity or installation veterinary
corps officer (VCO), the physical security inspector, safety personnel, and the KM must be consulted to
ensure that the minimum requirements are included in the final design. After kennel designs are completed
and construction costs are estimated, the kennel project is submitted to the installation commander for
approval and funding. The request for authorization of MWD teams must include the statement that the
commitment has been made to fund and build kennels within one year prior to the arrival of the MWDs at
the installation. Refer to Appendix B and DA Pam 190-12 for details on kennel construction.
PROCUREMENT
2-13. All MWDs must be procured from the procurement section at the 341st Training Squadron,
Lackland AFB, Texas. Local procurement of an MWD is prohibited. Requisition of an MWD team (one
dog and one handler) requires two separate transactions. Handlers are obtained as a result of a personnel
action requesting military police soldiers with the ASI Z6 in the required pay grades. MWDs are obtained
as a result of a supply action. Commanders will assign an appropriately qualified handler to every MWD
on hand. Assignment will be consistent with the policy of "one dog and one handler" as outlined in AR
190-12.
2-14. When the replacement of an MWD and not a handler is needed, requisitions are done according to
AR 700-81. Initial requisitions for dogs should be submitted when positions for handlers are authorized.
The MWDs in the Army supply system are—
z Dog, patrol: narcotic detector; national stock number (NSN) 8820-00-435-7542, line item
number (LIN) D33800.
z Dog, patrol: explosives detector; NSN 8820-00-188-3880, LIN G33732.
2-15. The method of how to replace an MWD that has died, been adopted, or has undergone euthanasia is
to submit a requisition in the MILSTRIP format that includes a statement that the unit or installation
already has a trained handler on station. The MILSTRIP should also be submitted when the VCO has
stated in writing that an MWD only has a 12-month life or work expectancy and/or is placed in deployment
category IV (permanently nondeployable).
2-16. KMs should send requisitions for new or replacement dogs, in the MILSTRIP format, to their local
property book office and forward a copy to their respective MACOM. The headquarters of the Air Force
Security Police Agency will review all requisitions for dogs prior to processing by the 341st Training
Squadron, Procurement Section.
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
2-17. Training is needed at each installation to ensure that teams remain proficient. This realistic and
challenging training should be scenario driven and relate to all of the possible operations in which MWD
teams will operate according to the unit METL. Properly trained MWD teams are better prepared to
accomplish all facets of MWD missions.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 2-3

Chapter 2
INITIAL TRAINING
2-18. MWD teams are initially trained at the 341st Training Squadron, Lackland AFB, Texas. This training
is done at a basic level for both the handler and the dog and is not intended to prepare either the handler or
the dog for immediate duty in an MWD team. The training is only intended to give a basic overview of the
MWD program, the health and care of MWDs, and proper training techniques. It is the responsibility of the
gaining unit to train a new handler or dog on all missions conducted by Army MWD teams. Proficiency
training is continuously required to ensure that teams are reliable for use in patrol, narcotic detection, and
explosive detection.
PROFICIENCY TRAINING
2-19. The effectiveness of MWDs trained in patrol, narcotic detection, or explosive detection depends on
the continual reinforcement of the abilities of the dog team through proficiency training. This training is
mandatory and if it is not conducted properly, an appointed certification authority can decertify the MWD
team. Failure to meet the minimum training standard for at least the 35 days prior to a certification action
will result in MWD teams not being evaluated for certification.
2-20. The minimum training standard is at least four hours of training each week in patrol and at least four
hours of training each week in narcotic or explosive detection. The minimum standard of proficiency to
maintain certification as a detector team is 90 percent or higher (with no more than a 10 percent false
response rate) for narcotic detector dogs, and 95 percent or higher (with no more than a 10 percent false
response rate) for explosive detector dogs.
2-21. Failure to maintain an average that meets or exceeds the minimum standard for three consecutive
training events will result in the automatic decertification of the MWD team. Decertified teams may not be
used in any way, and must undergo intensive retraining. These teams may be recertified only after
retraining and a consistent demonstration to an appointed certification authority. Proficiency training
should be conducted both on and off leash.
PROFICIENCY TRAINING OF PATROL DOG TEAMS
2-22. The effectiveness of PD teams depends on the continual reinforcement of mandatory proficiency
training. PD teams must receive a minimum of 4 hours of patrol proficiency training each week. The
training environment should approximate the military police working environment as closely as possible.
Training should occur at varying times throughout the day and night and on varying days of the week,
including weekends.
2-23. The emphasis in training is to develop the skills of both the handler and the dog so that they
complement each other and the team becomes a working unit. As a proficiency evaluation criterion, the
correct performance of the required task verifies that the handler understands how to control his PD and is
able to do so.
2-24. Train the PD to protect with or without command based on any perceived threat to the handler.
Because of the potential of serious bodily injury in this specialty, the certification of the handler and the
dog as a team is very stringent. Ensure that the proficiency training of PDs includes an emphasis on critical
tasks. There are no waivers for failure to accomplish a critical task by a PD team.
WEAPON FIRE TRAINING
2-25. Training on weapon firing ranges is essential for the PD to become proficient and not be deterred
from attacking agitators during gunfire. The dog must not attack the handler during gunfire. The firing of
all weapons assigned to the handler should be done with the MWD present whenever possible. PDs can be
desensitized with the firing of many different types of weapons. This can often be accomplished by
arranging for the handlers to take the dogs to weapon ranges of different units.
2-26. Determine the dog's reaction to the sound of gunfire. It may be necessary for the handler to use
counterconditioning techniques until the desired proficiency is achieved. Counterconditioning techniques
2-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Administrative Requirements
include starting at distances of 300 meters and slowly bringing the gunfire closer to the dog (or as safety
allows, bringing the dog closer to the weapon). The goal is for the dog not to bark or show any signs of
aggression when the handler fires all assigned weapons. This can be a slow process over the course of
several days.
OBEDIENCE COURSE TRAINING
2-27. The obedience course exposes the PD to various obstacles (see Figure 2-1) that simulate walls, open
windows, tunnels, ramps, or steps. The dog's exposure to these obstacles reduces the amount of time
required to adapt dogs to different environments. The dog learns to negotiate each of the obstacles. When
confronted with a similar obstacle in the working environment, the dog is not deterred from completing his
mission. The obedience course also develops the handler's ability to control the dog's behavior both on and
off leash. The obedience course is not a substitute for exercise. A dog should never be required to negotiate
the obedience course until he has been warmed up by proper exercise.
Figure 2-1. Obedience Course Obstacles
PROFICIENCY TRAINING OF DETECTOR DOG TEAMS
2-28. Continuous training of detector dogs is required so they maintain proficiency in the ability to seek
and find drugs or explosives, depending on their specialty. Ensure that the detector training is always
documented properly. Documentation and training are critical to both maintaining team certification and to
establishing probable cause for a search based on a detector dog's number of correct responses.
2-29. There are several differences in the training requirements for PNDD and PEDD. Proficiency training
scenarios for both types of detector dogs must be varied to avoid conditioning the dogs to a repetitious
training pattern. The following factors will be varied for each proficiency training exercise:
z The general training exercise area.
z The number of training aids planted.
z The specific locations of the training aids in the area being used for training.
z The amount of explosives or drugs used in the training aid plant.
z The type of explosives or drugs used.
z The time of day or night of the training.
z The type of training aid container.
z The type of distraction material planted with the training aid.
z The length of time the training aid is left in place before the detector dog team search.
z The person used to handle and/or plant the training aid.
z The height above or below the floor level of the training aid plants.
z The size of the room or area in which the training aids are planted.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 2-5

Chapter 2
DECOYS
2-30. The decoy is the person who role-plays the primary adversary for training and evaluating the MWD
team. The decoy may be a suspect, a subject, an attacker, an agitator, a drunk, an escapee, an enemy, or any
of a number of other persons an MWD team may expect to encounter while performing military police
duties. A decoy may also be neutral or an ally, such as another military policeman, a supervisor, a lost
juvenile, or an innocent person passing through an identification check. Use both males and females for
decoys, agitators, and suspect role-players. Vary the clothing the role-players are dressed in to expose the
dogs to civilian, military, and the ethnic dress of different countries, if possible.
2-31. Decoys must be taught how to handle the arm protector sleeve or wrap and other aggression tools
such as the bite suit (Figure 2-2), the hidden wrap, and leg wraps for self–protection when the dog attacks.
The sleeve or wrap used should be a hidden sleeve rather than the full, heavy padded sleeve. The hidden
sleeve can be concealed under a sweater or field jacket to achieve more realistic conditions for training the
MWD.
Figure 2-2. Bite Suit
2-32. KMs and plans NCOs teach decoys how to understand and use the different drives the MWD shows.
Once understood, these drives or needs of the MWD can be exploited to cause the desired result in
training. Decoys must learn the type of pattern to take to and from the MWD when training on aggression
tasks or the bite. For safety and optimum training effect, decoys will learn how to target the MWD into the
bite gear and what actions to take during a partial and full bite.
VALIDATION
2-33. The KM or plans NCO will conduct a validation prior to requesting certification. Validations will
then be conducted quarterly to verify the patrol and detection accuracy rates recorded on DA Form 2807-R
(Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record) and/or DA Form 3992–(R) (Narcotics or
Explosives Detector Dog Training and Utilization Record). Additional validations will be given to any
patrol or detector MWD whose demonstrated proficiency appears to differ significantly from the rating
recorded on his DA Form 2807-R and/or DA Form 3992–R. The validation will verify proficiency or
identify the specific patrol/detector weaknesses that need corrective training.
2-34. Validations include at least 30 trials for a narcotic detector dog and at least 40 trials for an explosive
detector dog. These trials will be divided equally with each substance the dog is trained to detect. Training
aids will be distributed in at least five different areas over a five–day period. These areas should include (if
available) vehicles, barracks, open areas, warehouses, theaters, planes, and luggage. A written record of the
evaluation and validation will be maintained on record for a minimum of two years.
2-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Administrative Requirements
CERTIFICATION OF MILITARY WORKING DOG TEAMS
2-35. AR 190-12 defines the standards and specific requirements for all certification of MWD teams.
Certification of an MWD and handler is valid for one year and is immediately nullified when—
z The dog is assigned to another handler.
z The handler and MWD have been separated or have not conducted training for thirty-five or
more consecutive days.
z The team fails to meet the minimum detector standard of 95 percent accuracy (explosives) and
90 percent accuracy (narcotics) with no more than a 10 percent false response rate for three
consecutive months.
SCOUTING OR PATROLLING
2-36. The PD must be able to detect a person by scent, sound, and sight (on leash only). This task is rated
critical. The following tasks must be accomplished to demonstrate proficiency in scouting or patrolling:
z Daytime standards.
Detect and respond to the scent of a person who is hidden within 75 yards, and follow the

scent to the person's location.
Detect and respond to a sound made by a person 100 yards away, and follow this sound to

the source.
Visually detect and respond to a person in view 100 yards away, and pursue the person on

command.
Demonstrate proficiency in pursuit, attack, and release.

z Nighttime standards:
Detect and respond to the scent of a person who is hidden within 75 yards, and follow the

scent to the person's location.
Detect and respond to a sound made by a person 100 feet away, and follow this sound to the

source.
Demonstrate proficiency in pursuit, attack, and release.

Note. There is no nighttime standard for sight due to the dog's natural ability to revert to other
senses in the dark.
VEHICLE PATROL
2-37. The PD must be able to ride quietly and calmly inside a vehicle with the handler until provoked or
commanded. This is a semicritical task.
TRACKING
2-38. Tracking is the only noncritical task on which PDs are trained. Tracking is noncritical because not all
PDs have tracking potential. The local KM should know which dogs have been trained to track. PDs that
demonstrate a potential for tracking are identified by the KM or plans NCO at each unit, and the dogs are
then further developed in this task. Although tracking is a valuable skill for the PD team, improper
performance of the task does not degrade the overall effectiveness of the PD team to perform the military
police mission.
2-39. PDs selected for tracking training should be trained and employed for tracking on a tracking harness.
The harness serves as a useful cue to the PD that it should focus his senses on tracking. At the start of the
track, the handler will give the command "Track" and begin casting for the scent. Initially, scent pads are
identified and then an item with the tracklayer's scent on it will be used. The dog is required to track and
alert on any items left by the tracklayer.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 2-7

Chapter 2
2-40. The minimum level of proficiency a PD trained for tracking must attain is to be able to follow a
human scent at least one hour old, for 1 mile over varied terrain, and on a course with several turns. Given
suitable tracking conditions, a skilled tracker dog team can follow the natural wanderings of individuals or
groups of persons for at least 3.1 miles over rugged and varied terrain and on a scent track that is at least 12
hours old. While tracking, the dog is also capable of alerting his handler to the presence of tripwires and
ambushes.
2-41. Evaluation of tracking tasks must include various ages and lengths of the track. The areas used to
conduct tracking training and evaluations will be rotated frequently. Tracks will be at least one-third of a
mile long but no longer than one mile. The age should vary from ten minutes to one hour. Tracks will
include turns, but evaluators should ensure that the person laying the tracks is not trying to deceive the dog
with undue tracklaying. Articles will be placed on the track for the dog to find.
INSPECTIONS
2-42. Inspections help ensure that the MWD section is in compliance with Army standards. Appendix C
contains an example inspection memorandum to assist the inspection officials on what areas to inspect at
an MWD section.
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY INSPECTIONS
2-43. Personnel from headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), conduct annual inspections of the
MACOM MWD program. These inspections are used to assist the MACOM PM and program manager in
moving the MACOM MWD program forward. This inspection will be on all aspects of the MACOM
MWD program (see Appendix C).
MAJOR ARMY COMMAND INSPECTIONS
2-44. MACOM program managers conduct annual inspections of handlers, MWDs, training, team use,
team proficiency, equipment, and kennel facilities. This ensures compliance with AR 190-12.
PROVOST MARSHAL AND COMMANDER INSPECTIONS
2-45. PMs and/or commanders conduct monthly inspections of handlers, MWDs, training, team use, team
proficiency, equipment, and kennel facilities. These inspections are conducted at least monthly on one or
more areas of the kennels and quarterly on all aspects of the installation MWD section to ensure
compliance with AR 190-12.
2-46. A written record of the monthly and quarterly inspection is maintained on file with the appropriate
corrective action (both in memorandum format), stating the corrective action taken for each deficiency.
This written record is maintained for one year past the inspection date.
2-47. The responsible VCO will conduct an inspection of the kennel facility at least quarterly to ensure
health and welfare for both the handlers and dogs assigned to the MWD section. A copy of this inspection
is maintained on file for a minimum of two years. The responsible PM and/or commander takes all actions
necessary to correct any deficiencies noted by the VCO. Veterinary inspections are to be conducted
monthly, if possible.
TRAINING RECORDS
2-48. There are two forms that must be used to annotate MWD training, DA Forms 2807-R and 3992-R.
These forms are official military documents and must be maintained daily with factual information. Many
times these documents are used as court documents, so the importance of the completion and accuracy of
these documents cannot be stressed enough. Example forms and the procedures for filling these forms out
are in Appendix D.
2-8 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Administrative Requirements
PROBABLE CAUSE FOLDERS
2-49. Probable cause folders are one of the most important methods of proving an MWD team's reliability.
Legal requirements to conduct a search of private property based on the response of an MWD do not allow
the probable cause folder a margin for error. All the items contained in the probable cause folder are
copies. The following original records must be kept on file at the kennel facility:
z Department of Defense (DD) Form 1834 (Military Working Dog Service Record). DD Form
1834 must be maintained on the MWD and kept as the initial form in the probable cause folder.
This form must be accurate and signed on a change of a handler. When the MWD is trained on
new substances, ensure that they are listed on the DD Form 1834. The 341st Training Squadron
at Lackland AFB, Texas, must approve new substances.
z Lackland AFB Form 375 (Patrol Dog Certification). Lackland AFB Form 375 follows the DD
Form 1834 in the probable cause folder and lists patrol certification information for the MWD.
z Lackland AFB Form 375a (Detector Dog Certification). Lackland AFB Form 375a follows the
Lackland AFB 375 (if dual certified), and lists postgraduation certification information for the
MWD.
z Air Force (AF) Form 1256 (Certificate of Training). A copy of the handler's AF Form 1256
follows Lackland AFB Form 375a. The handler provides a copy of the AF Form 1256 for the
probably cause folder.
z Certification Letter. This letter attests to the fact that the appointed certification authority has
witnessed a demonstration of the capabilities of the dog team. This letter, at a minimum, should
list the handler and dog, the whelp, the type of MWD (PEDD or PNDD), the social security
number (SSN) of the handler, and the date of certification. This letter should be maintained in
the probable cause folder after the handler's graduation certificate until the next certification of
the team or a change of handler.
z Quarterly Validation and Evaluation by the KM. This document is used to show that the KM
has conducted a quarterly evaluation on the MWD team. If the KM is not available, the plans
NCO can also conduct this evaluation. This document follows the certification letter in the
probable cause folder.
z Training and Utilization Records. The last items that should be maintained in the probable
cause folder are the last three months of training and utilization records for the MWD team.
These records include DA Forms 2807-R and 3992-R. Once an additional month has passed, the
latest month will be transferred to the MWD team folder in the filing system.
TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS
2-50. Every unit, installation, and activity with MWD teams should assign enough support vehicles so that
all missions and kennel support activities can be properly conducted and maintained. The minimum
standard for transportation is one support vehicle per two MWD teams (two dogs and two handlers).
Vehicle requirements should be determined by mission requirements and the overall number of MWD
teams. Some modifications are necessary so that the MWD can be seen and can provide a visual deterrence
during law and order or force protection and antiterrorism missions. These modifications will maximize the
mission effectiveness of the dog while providing the dog with a comfortable, supportive, and protective
area inside the vehicle. This type of modification is normally a kennel crate or cage secured in the rear of
the vehicle; the crate or cage should have a nonslippery surface.
2-51. MWD handlers perform complex missions. Four-by-four type passenger vehicles should be used to
ensure that MWD teams can get to any mission during inclement weather or on rough terrain.
2-52. Pickup trucks are essential for the transportation of explosive training aids. AR 190-12 lists the
requirements for explosives transported in government vehicles. However, pickup trucks should not be
used for transporting MWDs for training or during road patrol type duties. This vehicle offers limited
protection for the MWD from inclement weather and innocent bystanders.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 2-9

Chapter 2
2-53. Warning signs stating "CAUTION—MILITARY WORKING DOGS" should be placed on all sides
and the rear of any and all vehicles used to transport MWDs. The signs should also be printed in the host
nation language. The only exception to this is the use of unmarked vehicles for President of the United
States and Vice-President of the United States missions.
NARCOTICS AND EXPLOSIVE TRAINING AIDS
2-54. Detector dog training and evaluations require the frequent use of narcotic and explosive training
aids. Due to the potential safety hazards and risks involved with these aids, it is absolutely mandatory for
all MWD personnel and commanders to know and follow the regulatory guidance. MWD leaders and
handlers must participate in periodic review and training on the requirements noted in AR 190-12. These
requirements are clearly stated in AR 190-12.
2-10 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Chapter 3
Managing Military Working Dog Operations
Managing an MWD program requires attention from the program manager, the KM,
and the plans NCO. This chapter will help these individuals better understand their
specific requirements and concerns regarding the scheduling of various missions.
SCHEDULING AND EMPLOYMENT
3-1. The KM or plans NCO assists and advises the commander or operations officer in scheduling and
employing MWD teams. The KM and plans NCO are the most qualified to determine the duty schedules,
work cycles, and hours of operation to support each mission. All MWD teams should be utilized at least 24
hours per week to perform nontraining related duties.
3-2. Scheduling must allow for a minimum of four hours of patrol proficiency training per week and four
hours of detector training per week. Details concerning proficiency training requirements are discussed in
Chapter 2. Daily scheduling should include enough time for feeding, grooming, and exercising the MWDs
as well as maintaining equipment and kennel facilities.
PREDEPLOYMENT OPERATIONS
3-3. MWD leaders and planners need to ensure that handlers are prepared for all possible missions before
the moment of execution. Careful planning and concurrent training is an ongoing process that involves all
soldiers in every kennel section. No MWD team should ever be sent on a mission without the proper
preparation.
PROGRAM MANAGERS PREDEPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
3-4. MACOM program managers play a key role in MWD team readiness. The careful management of
information concerning each kennel enables leaders and planners to keep the unit in a constant state of
readiness for any possible deployment or no-notice mission.
3-5. Program managers keep track of the—
z Total number of personnel at each kennel in the MACOM.
z Certification status of all teams at each kennel in the MACOM.
z Deployability status of all MWDs and handlers (see Chapter 8).
z Total number and location of deployed MWD teams.
z Status of kennel facilities at deployment locations.
z Status of VCO support at deployment locations.
KENNEL MASTER PREDEPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
3-6. The KM's responsibility is to ensure the daily accomplishment of all missions. The readiness of all
assigned MWD teams is a process that requires continuous effort from all leaders. KMs must maintain
statistics and make the necessary corrections to have all personnel and equipment available for future
deployments and missions.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 3-1

Chapter 3
3-7. The KM is responsible for—
z Managing the number of personnel assigned to each kennel.
z Verifying the status of certified teams and the dates of certification.
z Maintaining the deployability status of MWDs and handlers.
z Ensuring that soldiers have soldier readiness packets prepared according to AR 600-8-101.
z Conducting monthly and quarterly counseling.
z Maintaining accurate and detailed training records that will give the forward deployed KM an
understanding of strengths and weaknesses.
z Ensuring that MWD handler equipment for short-notice deployments is prepared at all times.
z Conducting annual 9-millimeter handgun qualification. More than one qualification should be
conducted (if possible) to better train MWD handlers on the use of the 9-millimeter handgun and
to ensure that handlers are always qualified.
z Ensuring that handlers meet the standards outlined in AR 600-9 and FM 21-20 by conducting
height and weight testing and physical fitness tests.
z Ensuring that the mandatory common military training and common task tests are conducted
according to AR 350-1.
z Training soldiers in tasks associated with deployments (for example, kennel setup, utilization,
and missions).
z Ensuring that MWD handlers have received any needed driver's licenses or transportation motor
pool (TMP) licenses before a deployment order arrives.
z Ensuring that soldiers have received the needed individual readiness training in preparation for
deployment in a combat zone.
z Conducting mine awareness training.
PLANS NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER PREDEPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
3-8. Deployment planning must include coordination with the supporting military VCO. The plans NCO
must consider the expected duration of the deployment and the types of facilities anticipated at the
destination.
3-9. The plans NCO is responsible for ensuring that the handlers and MWDs in the MWD team or kennel
section are technically proficient. The plans NCO is best able to evaluate and recommend to the KM which
MWD team is most qualified and prepared for deployments and missions. Through continuous and realistic
predeployment training, the plans NCO ensures that the MWD teams are proficient in—
z Crowd control training.
z Building searches.
z Tactical movements (through obstacles and from point to point).
z Gunfire training (handler and decoy).
z Defense training.
z Controlled aggression.
z Explosive detection (area searches, bunker searches, and tactical vehicle searches).
z Narcotics detection (area searches, bunker searches, and tactical vehicle searches).
ADDITIONAL PREDEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
3-10. Army mobility requirements necessitate that each MWD has a shipping crate. Shipping crates are
used to transport MWDs, simplify handling and loading, and give MWDs adequate space and ventilation
during transport. Shipping crates may also be used as temporary kennels at intermediate sites or at the
deployment destination.
3-11. The average water requirement for a single MWD is 10 gallons a day. Enough dog food must be
taken to last 90 days or until resupply can be established. MWDs must be fed the standard
3-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Managing Military Working Dog Operations
high-performance dog food, contracted and supplied by the General Services Administration (GSA), unless
otherwise directed by the supporting VCO. MWDs are fed twice daily unless the supporting VCO directs
another meal frequency.
3-12. First aid kits must accompany the MWD team on every mission. Information on the deployment
destination, climate, and terrain help determine the specific contents of the first aid kits. For example, if
MWDs are employed on rough terrain, a pad toughener is included in the first aid kit.
3-13. All mission-related equipment must travel and arrive with MWD teams so that they can be fully
operational as quickly as possible. Any equipment that is not sent with the MWD teams should be sent by
other means to arrive at the location within 60 days of the MWD team's arrival. An example equipment list
is in Appendix E.
DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
3-14. There are many important factors to consider when leaders and MWD planners are preparing for
deployments. To ensure that every deployment results in mission success, every aspect from notification to
redeployment must be considered. These aspects include, but are not limited to, field kennels, training, and
operations.
FIELD KENNELS AND SUPPORT FACILITIES
3-15. A suitable kennel site must be carefully selected. Before deployment, some possible locations may
be selected on a map from a leader's reconnaissance. As soon as possible after arrival, the sites should be
inspected to choose the most suitable location. When selecting a site, consult a VCO (whenever possible)
about possible health hazards.
3-16. Locating the kennel in a congested area may be necessary to protect it from enemy attack. A
temporary screen or physical barrier may be needed to block the dog's sight so he will be able to rest.
3-17. When shipping crates are used as temporary kennels, the interior, exterior, and ground beneath the
crate must be cleaned daily to prevent the accumulation of moisture and waste or insect infestation. It must
be raised four to six inches off the ground to allow for adequate drainage and to reduce parasite breeding
places. In hot climates, place crates under trees, a tarpaulin, or plywood to provide shade and ventilation.
Spread gravel (if available) around and under the crates to allow for drainage and the easy removal of solid
waste. A large tent or prefabricated building can serve as a temporary storage location for equipment,
rations, and other supplies.
3-18. A second tent or building erected at the kennel site to house handlers and the KM provides the
kennel with sufficient manpower for security of the kennel area. Although conditions around a temporary
kennel may be primitive, a high standard of sanitation is essential to prevent diseases and parasite
infections. Permanent kennel facilities must be erected within one year of the arrival of MWD teams to the
location of operational use. Modular expandable MWD transport containers (NSN 961120, 961130, or an
equivalent) (Figure 3-1, page 3-4) with integrated air conditioning, heating, and equipment storage are
recommended for use as temporary kennels in field environments.
DEPLOYMENT TRAINING
3-19. As soon as possible after arriving at the deployment destination and while making sure that site
security is established, deployment training must begin. Deployment training allows the MWD teams to
quickly develop familiarity with their new location. This is also known as right-seat ride time. The KM or
plans NCO needs to evaluate or reevaluate the degree of skill of each of the MWD teams so that the KM
and NCO are fully prepared to support the deployed force. Initial evaluation and training should consist
primarily of field problems such as attack, search, re-attack, and scouting and basic obedience. Training
should also include the handler firing his assigned weapon while maintaining control of the MWD. Some
training should be done at dusk, and then in darkness, so that the handler may see (for safety) and the
MWD may adjust to the noise and flash of weapons.

MANEUVER AND MOBILITY SUPPORT OPERATIONS
3-20. MMSO consist of measures necessary to enhance combat movement and the ability to conduct
movement of friendly resources in all environments. These measures ensure that commanders receive
personnel, equipment, and supplies as needed. MMSO is conducted across the full spectrum of military
operations. The primary focus of military police during MMSO is to ensure the swift and uninterrupted
movement of combat power and logistical support. KM teams will coordinate MWD operations with the
plans and operations officer or task force commander.
AREA SECURITY OPERATIONS
3-21. When setting up listening posts or conducting combat patrols, consider the availability and suitability
of PDs for the particular mission. The KM or plans NCO must be briefed early regarding the mission. This
will ensure that the most suitable PD team can be selected and that the handler can prepare for the mission.
The handler should check the MWD for any limiting ailments and conduct training rehearsals to become
familiar with the mission. The KM or plans NCO and selected handlers must be involved in planning
conferences and briefings involving the utilization of an MWD team.
3-22. In defensive operations, combat patrols are used to provide early warning, to confirm intelligence
information, and to detect or deter enemy action. PD teams greatly enhance the security of reconnaissance
and combat patrols.
3-23. On combat patrols, a PD works at maximum efficiency for only two or three hours. During
inclement or extreme hot or cold weather, this time will vary. The KM, plans NCO, and VCO should
advise the commander on the MWDs' particular capabilities. The team is most effective in uninhabited
areas. If an MWD frequently alerts on friendly forces and is continuously taken off his alert, he soon loses
interest and reliability. Only the best teams should be selected.
Defiles and Route Reconnaissance/Surveillance Operations
3-24. MWD teams can be used to enhance the security at defile and route reconnaissance/surveillance
operations. Consider the following to ensure mission success:
z The mission at hand (the possible threat scenario).
z The size of the area to be covered.
3-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Managing Military Working Dog Operations
z The type and number of MWD teams.
z The duration of the mission.
z Sustainment supplies.
z Communications.
3-25. Operational planning must ensure that the proper numbers and types of teams are requested to
perform the mission. Planning considerations must allow for proper rotations and rest-to-work ratios for
the MWD teams.
Checkpoints
3-26. MWD teams are often called on to enhance the effectiveness of checkpoints. After receiving the
mission to perform checkpoint duty, planners and handlers need to consider the following:
z The force protection condition (FPCON) (see Appendix F for details).
z The type and number of teams required versus those available.
z Sustainment equipment.
z Communications.
z Available support elements.
Area Defense
3-27. Areas that cannot be covered by static defensive posts because of vegetation, terrain, or some other
peculiar feature can be secured using PD teams. Prior to positioning any MWD team in a defensive
posture, ensure that intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) details any possible placement of
friendly or enemy mines. When relieving others from established defensive positions, use range cards to
familiarize the team with the area.
3-28. A PD team can detect personnel using concealed avenues of approach and provide an early warning
to defenders. Each MWD team's area of responsibility should be large enough so that the team can move to
take advantage of the prevailing wind directions. A fixed position should be established to provide
covering fire for each MWD team in case the team must withdraw closer to the defensive perimeter after
the MWD has alerted on an attempted hostile probe or penetration.
WARNING AND RESPONSE PROCEDURES
3-29. Several procedures should be developed for warning friendly forces of a PD's response because
circumstances may prevent the use of a radio. Also, different types of responses tailored to fit a variety of
potential situations should be developed. For example, it may be desirable to have the MWD team follow
the alert and locate the cause. At other times, combat intelligence may require the team to maintain the alert
position until assistance arrives or to withdraw to a more advantageous position. Whatever action is taken,
the handler should not release an MWD unless it is necessary to defend—
z Himself.
z Other personnel.
z Protected resources.
INTERNMENT AND RESETTLEMENT OPERATIONS
3-30. I/R operations consist of those measures necessary to guard, protect, and account for people that are
captured, detained, confined, or evacuated by US forces. In any military operation involving US forces,
accountability and the safe and humane treatment of detainees is essential. US policy demands that all
persons who are captured, interned, evacuated, or held by US forces are treated humanely. This policy
applies from the moment detainees become the responsibility of US forces and continues until the time
they are released or repatriated. (See ARs 190-8 and 190-47 and FMs 3-19.40 and 27-10.)
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 3-5

Chapter 3
3-31. MWDs offer a psychological and actual deterrent against physical threats presented by personnel
housed in an I/R facility. They cannot be used as security measures against US military prisoners. MWDs
reinforce security measures against penetration and attack by small enemy forces that may be operating in
the area. MWDs also provide a positive, effective alternative to using firearms when preventing
disturbances or escapes by personnel.
3-32. MWD handlers will not use their MWDs to guard prisoners inside prisons or detainee holding
facilities and confinement facilities. In addition, MWD handlers will not use their MWDs to degrade,
torture, injure, or mistreat EPWs, detained personnel, civilian internees (CIs), or other detainees in US
custody.
Demonstrations
3-33. Conduct periodic demonstrations in full view of personnel housed in an I/R facility to increase the
psychological deterrent of an MWD. Emphasize how easily and quickly an MWD can overtake a fleeing
individual. Highlight the MWD's ability to attack and overcome physical resistance. Demonstrate an
MWD's scouting ability. To ensure a successful demonstration, use only the most qualified MWD teams.
Perimeter Security
3-34. Use an MWD team as an addition to perimeter security by making periodic, unscheduled patrols
around the perimeter fence during periods of darkness. During inclement weather, a temporary blackout or
an electrical failure increases the number and frequency of patrols.
WARNING
Never set patterns or establish routines when conducting
security patrols. Enemy observing security measures can exploit
set times by attacking when the patrol ends or before it begins.
Narcotic and/or Explosives Detection
3-35. Walk an MWD team through living areas to search for contraband. PEDD teams can be utilized to
detect explosive devices and components in the I/R facility and PNDD teams can be utilized to detect
narcotics.
Work Details
3-36. Position an MWD team between the work detail and the area offering the greatest avenue of escape.
MWD teams provide a valuable addition to work detail guards, particularly those employed in areas
offering the greatest potential for escape. However, MWD teams are deterrents and must not be used as
guards.
POLICE INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS
3-37. AR 525-1 3 directs all military law enforcement to develop foreign and domestic criminal intelligence.
MWD teams are an integral part of the police intelligence operations (PIO) process. PIO are conducted in
conjunction with all functions in which the MWD teams perform. For example, a PEDD team working at a
checkpoint to detect explosives will also be gathering intelligence. This holds true for all MWD functions.
3-38. Leaders and planners of MWD operations must develop procedures to ensure that the MWD teams
gather and submit all intelligence in a timely manner. Standardized reports are an effective means that
allow for the accurate and detailed submission of intelligence. Contact the supporting intelligence section
(S2), provost marshal office (PMO), or CID office to ensure that all PIO coordination is in place prior to
performing MWD functions.
3-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Managing Military Working Dog Operations
LAW AND ORDER OPERATIONS
3-39. Law and order operations are those that MWD teams perform to enforce laws, orders, and
regulations and to maintain discipline and safety. Law and order operations can be performed in both
combat and peacetime environments
RANDOM ANTITERRORISM MEASURES PROGRAM
3-40. The random antiterrorism measures program (RAMP) is designed to be used at all FPCON levels to
increase physical security awareness throughout an installation. RAMP involves the random use of
measures, identified in AR 525-13 and TC 19-210, for FPCON levels to make installation operations less
predictable and therefore more secure.
3-41. The use of MWD teams during RAMP provides for more thorough detection of narcotics and/or
explosives and for a psychological deterrent. An MWD presence can also increase confidence in
installation security in general.
3-42. KMs coordinate with the PMO or S3 to ensure that RAMP checks are successful. Coordination will
include—
z The reconnaissance of patrol areas (map reconnaissance as a minimum).
z Rehearsals and inspections before operations.
z Transportation.
z Equipment needed on site.
z A threat briefing.
z Rules of engagement.
z Use-of-force criteria.
z After-action review (AAR) requirements (see Appendix D).
TEMPORARY DUTY MISSIONS (UNITED STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE/HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL
SECURITY MISSIONS)
3-43. USCS safeguards the internal security of the United States through border searches. Because of this,
they have broad powers in conducting searches. By utilizing an MWD team, all vehicles, ships, luggage,
and baggage can be checked at border clearance crossings or ports. MWD teams are called upon to support
local or federal authorities in detection operations. The Joint Enforcement Military Customs Operation
places MWDs at border clearance ports to conduct searches of vehicles and cargo entering the United
States. The MWD team takes no law enforcement action. The MWD team only searches and reports.
AR 90-12 gives a more detailed explanation of civil support by MWD teams.
3-44. The Air Force has been designated to serve as the primary service point of contact for all very
important person (VIP) missions received from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, USSS, and/or
Department of State. The VIP coordination officer who (under authority from the Secretary of Defense)
tasks and coordinates all missions performed by DOD PEDD team personnel, regardless of service
affiliation, issues all mission tasks.
3-45. MWD leaders and planners ensure that the certification of the team selected to perform the mission
is well documented and current. Other considerations in planning for USCS support include—
z The travel arrangements of the MWD team.
z Government travel credit cards.
z Lodging for the handler.
z The kennel and boarding.
z VCO support.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 3-7

Chapter 3
MILITARY WORKING DOG PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS
3-46. Public demonstrations are conducted to show the abilities of MWD teams. These demonstrations are
coordinated through the KM to ensure that the appropriate team is available for the target audience. The
goal of public demonstrations is to deter criminal activity and to promote public acceptance of the MWD.
3-47. At no time should demonstrations make an MWD a form of entertainment. The KM or plans NCO
should ensure that the details of sensitive police training techniques are not explained to the public. Avoid
lengthy or frequent public demonstrations that allow MWDs to tire easily or become bored.
HEALTH AND WELFARE DEMONSTRATIONS
3-48. Initially, the MWD team should provide the responsible commander with a basic demonstration of
the MWD's ability. The KM or plans NCO places a training aid in an undisclosed location, and the handler
enters the search area with the MWD. The handler presents and conducts a systematic search of the area.
When the MWD alerts, the appropriate reward is given. This demonstrates the MWD team's proficiency.
3-49. After the demonstration has been conducted, the unit should ensure that the area being searched is
free of soldiers and that all rooms are unlocked. MWD teams are a tool the commander uses to find any
illicit narcotic or explosive devices. It is the responsibility of the unit to properly search the room after the
MWD has cleared the room. If the MWD team responds, military police personnel are called to continue
the search. The MWD handler conducting the search should not search for the illicit narcotics or
explosives. Unit commanders should also ensure that no personnel enter the building or area until the
search is complete. This is usually accomplished by placing NCOs at various entranceways to stop
personnel from entering the area.
COMPETITIVE EVENTS
3-50. MWD teams should be encouraged and allowed to participate in competitive events, seminars, or
conferences conducted by outside agencies or police canine organizations. Exposure to competitive events
can challenge MWD teams to develop skills or learn advanced employment and training techniques. These
events may require new tasks or methods that the handler can use to identify and apply to military
missions. In this way, the team's proficiency and effectiveness are enhanced.
RECOVERY OPERATIONS
3-51. After every deployment or extended off-site mission, MWD leaders need to ensure that vital actions
are conducted upon the return of the MWD team. These actions include—
z Conducting an AAR after every MWD deployment or extended mission to assist in capturing
lessons learned. See Appendix G for detailed information on AARs.
z Conducting veterinary inspections.
z Returning any explosive or narcotic training aids.
z Updating training requirements and records.
z Recertifying teams.
3-8 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Chapter 4
Legal Considerations
The use of MWDs has the same legal considerations as the use of a military police
soldier. Each situation and location may be subject to various Status of Forces
Agreements (SOFAs), general orders, and other legal restrictions. The following
chapter addresses some fundamental areas. It is important to consult with the Staff
Judge Advocate whenever legal questions pertaining to an MWD arise.
USE OF FORCE
4-1. Procedures for the use of force are found in AR 190–14. This regulation states that personnel
engaged in law enforcement or security duties will use the minimum amount of force necessary to control
the situation. This regulation further details the levels of force and encourages commanders to substitute
nonlethal measures for firearms when they are considered adequate for safely performing force protection,
antiterrorism, and law and order functions. The regulation states that in evaluating the degree of force
required for specific situations, the following options should be considered in the order listed:
z Verbal persuasion.
z Unarmed defense techniques.
z Chemical aerosol irritant projectors (subject to host nation or local restrictions).
z The military police baton.
z MWDs.
z The presentation of a deadly force capability.
z Deadly force.
4-2. Although high in the order of measures, it is clear that the release of the MWD as a use of force is a
nonlethal option to be used before deadly force is considered. It must be understood that the release of an
MWD to pursue, bite, and hold a person is likely to result in an injury to the suspect. This injury can be
very minor such as scratches or bruises; however, serious bodily harm is possible. For this reason, it is
required by AR 190-14 that all lesser means of force must be used first whenever possible.
4-3. The use of force differs between MWD handlers and regular military police because of the
uniqueness of the MWD. Positive control of the MWD must be maintained at all times throughout all of
the use-of-force measures. Often, just the presence or arrival of a handler with his MWD can control a
situation. If the desired level of control is not achieved, verbal persuasion is the first degree of force to be
used. If verbal persuasion is not enough force to maintain or gain control, the next measure may be
considered. If the situation allows, military police may use unarmed defense techniques, spray irritants, and
the baton before MWD handlers use the MWD as a measure of force.
4-4. A handler is not likely to use unarmed defense techniques when holding an MWD on leash. The
handler must remain in positive control of the MWD; therefore he will not be able to get close enough to a
suspect to employ unarmed defense techniques. The use of chemical aerosol irritant projectors or the baton
would also hinder the handler's ability to keep positive control of the MWD. Therefore, the options are not
reasonable measures of force available to the handler.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 4-1

Chapter 4
4-5. Military police and task force commanders, along with PMs, establish clear policies regarding the
release of MWDs according to ARs 190-12 and 190-14. If the minimum amount of force necessary to
control the situation requires the use of MWD force off leash, the handler must ensure that the following
steps are followed:
z Ensure that the MWD has identified the same target as the handler before releasing him to bite.
z Give the warning order, "Halt, halt, halt, or I will release my dog." If assigned in a foreign
country, give the order in the primary language of the host nation.
z Warn all bystanders to cease all movement.
z Call the MWD off the pursuit and regain control of him if the suspect indicates surrender or
stops moving.
4-6. Use extreme caution when removing an MWD from a suspect. Regain and maintain leash control of
the MWD until he has become calm enough to obey the commands "Heel" and "Stay." Do not release an
MWD if the suspect is out of sight, unless an off-leash building search is authorized. Do not release
MWDs in areas where children are present.
4-7. MWD teams are not used for crowd control or direct confrontation with demonstrators unless the
responsible commander determines it to be absolutely necessary. When it is necessary, dogs are kept on a
short leash to minimize the danger to innocent persons. Dogs are not released into a crowd. Civil
disturbance contingency plans include specific criteria for the use of MWD teams that are consistent with
FM 3-19.15, AR 190-12, and AR 190–14.
SEARCHES
4-8. Rules 311 and 313 through 316, Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), prescribe HQDA policies
concerning the conduct of searches and inspections and the disposition of property seized in conjunction
with those activities. Property refers to property of the United States or of nonappropriated fund activities
of an armed force of the United States wherever it is located.
4-9. Commanders and law enforcement personnel must be aware of the distinction between searches,
seizures, inspections, and inventories and the provisions for the execution of these actions as outlined in
the MCM. Knowledge of this information is necessary to ensure the legal use of a PNDD or PEDD.
4-10. Probable cause is a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and that the person, property,
or evidence sought in connection with the crime is located in the place or on the person to be searched.
Probable cause must be established prior to searching any persons, property, or residence. Probable cause
can be established in the following ways:
z Personal observation.
z Information obtained from a reliable informant or from the witness who observed the crime.
z Use of a detector dog team.
z Any combination of these three.
4-11. The detector dog team is considered a "reliable informant," according to Rule 315 (f)(2), MCM. The
reliability of a team is established through the initial and annual certifications of the detector dog team by
the certification authority and through proper documentation of the MWD's training records.
4-12. Certification establishes the foundation for an officer to grant a search authorization or warrant.
Detector dogs are first certified after finishing their basic training. To meet the legal requirements
permitting their operational use, each detector dog team must undergo an annual certification and a
validation.
4-13. Each detector dog team undergoes a certification when first assigned to duty. A designated
certification authority conducts the certification. The detector dog team must perform a demonstration for
the person who authorizes any search. This may be any commander from company level up to the post
commander. The guideline is that the person who witnesses the demonstration can only authorize a search
of units he has command authority over. This person must also review the probable cause folder of the dog
4-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Legal Considerations
and must validate the team as reliable, in writing. This validation is good as long as the commander is
assigned to that command.
4-14. The certification authority should witness a demonstration of the dog's capabilities. All substances
the dog has been taught to respond on should be used. Additionally, the dog's capability to detect
past/present odor should be demonstrated. At the completion of the demonstration, the results are
documented in letter form, signed by the commander, and entered into the dog's probable cause folder. The
MWD handler is responsible for preparing and maintaining the probable cause folder and the contents (see
paragraph 2-49, page 2-9). The probable cause folder accompanies the handler each time the dog is used
on an actual search. Each document in the folder should be explained to the commander requesting a
detector dog search. The commander with command authority should witness a simple demonstration of
the dog's capabilities prior to a search. The above procedure should be followed whenever possible. This
procedure establishes the dog's reliability on a continuing basis and is essential in establishing probable
cause.
4-15. PEDD and PNDD teams must maintain high standards of accuracy to provide the desired level of
confidence in their searches. PNDD teams must maintain a 90 percent accuracy rate for the number of trials
conducted, while PEDD teams must maintain a 95 percent accuracy rate for the number of trials conducted.
The installation commander authorizes the support of local and federal law enforcement agencies. DOD
Instruction 3025.12 governs the use of all PEDD teams. It governs the use of PNDD teams and ensures
compliance with Section 1385, Title 18, United States Code (USC) (The Posse Comitatus Act) (18 USC
1385 [The Posse Comitatus Act]). Complete certification, recertification, and decertification details for
narcotic and explosive detector MWD teams can be found in AR 190-12.

Chapter 5
Patrol Dogs and Characteristics
PDs can be used in traditional law and order functions, but commanders and planners
should not overlook the tactical enhancements that a PD team offers to combat
support operations. All aspects of military police functions can be enhanced by the
employment of MWD teams. This chapter discusses many practical applications of
the PD team.
EMPLOYMENT TECHNIQUES DURING COMBAT SUPPORT
OPERATIONS
5-1. PD teams can perform many combat support operations. These teams enable the tactical commander
to free up soldiers and employ their resources in other areas. This force multiplier is especially valuable in
area security and force protection and antiterrorism operations.
PERIMETER SECURITY
5-2. PD teams are useful for perimeter (Figure 5-1, page 5-2) and distant support posts because they are
usually located away from normal activity and large numbers of people. These posts also usually enclose
large areas, and it would take a large number of single sentries to secure the area effectively. The large size
of these areas allows the PD team to change positions to take advantage of the prevailing wind direction.
These posts may be secured only during periods of advanced security and high threat. Occasional random
posting of these areas is recommended, especially during periods of limited visibility (rain, snow, dust,
smoke, and fog) or night conditions. Barriers and obstacles (such as fences, buildings, gullies, and streams)
must also be identified and considered in security post planning. Place the PD team so that these obstacles
offer the least interference to security.
5-3. Perimeter security, depending on the area to be covered, should use a two-team concept. The teams
overlap each other while walking around the perimeter. PD teams should not come into direct contact with
each other. Considerations include—
z The commander's intent.
z Priority intelligence requirements.
z Rules of engagement.
z Use-of-force criteria.
z The wind direction and distracters in the area (see Chapter 8).
z Friendly and enemy forces around the area.
z Rest areas within the perimeter to allow the MWD to relieve himself.
z Watchtowers or other security forces in the area.
5-4. The PD team should initiate the perimeter security operation by walking in a zigzag pattern around
the exterior perimeter. The team should be allowed to go outside of the security area to ensure that no
unwanted intruders are present.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 5-1

Chapter 5
Figure 5-1. Perimeter Security
INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM AUGMENTATION
5-5. Continuing development and use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for security make it
necessary to reassess the role of PD teams in the security of priority resources where IDSs are used.
Although IDSs are designed to greatly reduce the probability of a successful area penetration, they are not
designed to replace PD teams. IDSs cannot see beyond the outer clear zones, counter intrusions, or scout
the progress of an intruder force after penetration. They are also subject to malfunction and breakdown. PD
teams cannot counter all potential problems, but they can be used selectively to counter some of the IDS
limitations. With the advice of the KM, security planners should develop plans that set an effective balance
between sensor systems and PD teams. Some suggested functions for integrating PD teams into IDS-
augmented security systems are as follows:
z PD teams may be used inside or outside critical sites or locations of HRP type personnel areas to
give immediate response to areas not clearly seen by closed circuit television (CCTV) or to
support security response teams in their role of alarm assessment
z PD teams may be used to scout hidden intruders from the point of penetration to the hiding
location inside protected areas.
z PD teams may be posted outside critical sites during periods of increased threat to expand the
protected area beyond the range of the IDS. This use is particularly desirable when there is
heavy vegetation beyond the perimeter clear zone or when protected areas are located on or near
installation perimeters and may, therefore, be easily accessible to the public.
z PD teams may be used as an element of the security response team or as an element of other
designated response forces.
z PD teams may be used to compensate for decreased IDS effectiveness when poor visibility or
other environmental conditions adversely affect the IDS equipment or when the IDS is not
functioning.
5-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Patrol Dogs and Characteristics
SECONDARY RESPONSE FORCES
5-6. Secondary response forces are typically used as blocking forces and for sweeps and counterattacks.
PD teams can greatly improve the capabilities of the secondary response force. Some factors that must be
considered are that—
z Blocking positions must be selected downwind from the PD team's position when PDs are used
with blocking forces. In this type of mission, PDs should only be used to alert the forces of
possible intruders.
z The secondary response force moves into the wind with the PD team in the lead position when
the PDs are used for sweeps. It is imperative that security be placed on the PD teams to ensure
that they are protected.
z A PD team can often pinpoint the exact location of individual intruders.
5-7. A PD team can help detect, alert, and catch hidden intruders while clearing a position that has been
counterattacked successfully. PEDDs can be used to help clear the area of explosives. (See Chapter 7.)
LISTENING POSTS
5-8. On a listening post, the PD team should be positioned forward of the tactical area to reduce
distractions to the PD, yet close enough to maintain contact with friendly forces. In selecting a location,
consider the primary detection senses of the PD. Whenever possible, PD team listening posts should be
located downwind from any potential enemy position or dismount avenue of approach. Other locations
force the PD to rely only on his hearing and sight for detection, reducing his effective use of scent.
COMBAT PATROLS
5-9. In defensive operations, combat patrols are used to provide early warning, to confirm intelligence
information, and to detect or deter enemy action. PD teams greatly enhance the security of reconnaissance
and combat patrols.
5-10. On combat patrols, a PD works at maximum efficiency for only two or three hours. The team is most
effective in uninhabited areas. If a PD frequently alerts on friendly forces and is continuously taken off his
alert, he soon loses interest and reliability.
5-11. Patrol leaders and members must be briefed on actions to take when a dog handler is seriously
wounded or killed. Dogs that have worked closely with patrol members and have developed a tolerance for
one or more of them will usually allow one of the patrol members to return it to the kennel area. However,
the dog may refuse to allow anyone near his handler, and other handlers may need to be called to help. The
canine must be separated from the handler by—
z Coaxing the dog away with friendly words or food.
z Covering the dog with a poncho to immobilize it.
z Staking out the dog or leashing him.
5-12. A human will always take precedence over an animal. If no effort is effective, the dog may be
destroyed. However, all efforts should be made to avoid this; an MWD is an expensive and valuable asset
to replace.
5-13. If a situation arises where a canine is injured but the handler is not, the handler must be allowed to
accompany the canine. If wounded or killed, an MWD should be evacuated using the same assets and
should receive the same consideration as that given to a soldier under the same circumstances.
TACTICAL PATROLS
5-14. PD teams can be used in tactical patrols to detect enemy presence, to help the patrol avoid discovery,
and to locate enemy outposts. When the PD alerts, the handler should signal the patrol to halt until the
cause of the alert can be identified and the patrol can proceed safely. If a firefight develops while the PD
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 5-3

Chapter 5
team is at the point position, the PD team should respond to fire team's directions and act as a regular
member of the patrol.
5-15. Generally, the best locations for PD teams are directly in front of the patrol or on the flanks to
enhance the flexibility and security of the formation. Prevailing wind direction should be used to improve
the patrol's chances for early warning of enemy forces. If the wind direction is from the rear of the patrol,
the PD is forced to rely on sight and sound and may not be as effective. The handler must concentrate on
the PD to read his alert and will not be able to use a weapon rapidly. Therefore, members of the patrol
should be assigned to protect the PD team.
5-16. PD teams can be used to enhance the capabilities of an ambush patrol. A PD team should be placed
in front of the patrol to minimize distractions, yet close enough to maintain contact with other patrol
members. PDs on ambush patrols must remain silent and not respond aggressively to approaching enemy
forces.
INTERNMENT AND RESETTLEMENT OPERATIONS
5-17. PD teams are used during I/R operations for camp perimeter security and to guard against escapes.
The PD's keen senses of sight, smell, and hearing assist the handler and camp authorities in detecting
unauthorized activity. A PD team's presence also acts as a deterrent to escapes. In the event of an escape,
the PD is a valuable asset that can assist in the search and recovery of internees.
PD Duties and an Internment and Resettlement Camp in Iraq
On 13 April 2003, SGT Carey A. Ford and his MWD Rex responded to a riot at Camp
Bucca, Iraq. It was believed that an Iraqi internee had taken a pistol belt and some
personal equipment from a guard. The prisoner had taken this equipment back to his
tent and the 600 other internees refused to cooperate with the guard force. SGT Ford
and MWD Rex went into the I/R camp unarmed. The MWD team moved through the
disruptive and unruly crowd providing a secure environment for the quick-reaction
force to extract the prisoner and retrieve the stolen pistol belt and personal
equipment. SGT Ford related that EPWs would not come anywhere near his MWD
Rex. "We work that fear to our advantage."
Four days later, SGT Ford and Rex were called on to scout for and apprehend an
escaped EPW. The fugitive had a substantial lead on them, having made his escape
two hours prior to SGT Ford's notification. SGT Ford entered a possible unexploded
ordnance and/or antipersonnel minefield with Rex, who was also trained to detect
explosives. The MWD team was determined to locate the dangerous fugitive and
prevent access to any possible weapons caches since many had been located in the
area. After hours of relentless searching, SGT Ford and Rex located and
apprehended the escapee. Their actions provided the psychological deterrent
necessary to prevent future escape attempts.
RIOT/CROWD CONTROL
5-18. Extreme caution should be applied before committing PDs to a potential crowd control situation.
Although the presence of a PD can be a powerful statement to an enemy or terrorist, it can elicit a reverse
and potentially adverse effect on individuals in a riot/crowd control situation.
5-19. It is difficult to employ PDs properly during demonstrations or riots due to the high levels of
confusion and excitement and the large number of potential antagonists. PDs should be trained to remain
undistracted by loud noises and crowds. A crowd's reaction to a PD in a riot environment may be
dependent on the location. In some areas of the world, the appearance of PDs at an angry crowd scene
results in an escalation of violence. The crowd will often challenge soldiers to use the PDs as a measure of
force. This is particularly true if a situation can be manufactured or provoked so as to be interpreted as an
unreasonable use of force by the military. The presence of PDs can cause extreme fear (deterrence) in some
cultures and regions. This fear can be advantageous and should be exploited when needed.
5-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Patrol Dogs and Characteristics
5-20. Committed PD teams may be used as an alternative to the use of deadly force to gain control of a riot
situation. If the commander located on the ground directs the employment of PD teams for direct
confrontation with demonstrators, PD teams should be held in reserve, out of the sight of the crowd. As the
situation escalates, PD teams may be moved forward to within the sight of the crowd, but well away from
the front lines.
5-21. When committed to the front lines in direct confrontation, PDs are allowed to bite only under the
specific circumstances authorized by the responsible commander. PDs should never be released freely into
a crowd. Other riot control force personnel should be positioned approximately three meters from any PD
team when conducting any form of riot control. This is to prevent unintentional bite injuries to friendly,
riot control force personnel that may happen to get between a PD and an instigator participating in the riot
or demonstration.
5-22. PD teams must move a safe distance from the crowd to ensure the safety of the PD. Use of PD teams
for direct confrontation with demonstrators is not recommended. According to the Army's use-of-force
policy, the application of physical force against a person who cannot reasonably be suspected of
committing an offense is not appropriate. Presence in a crowd does not necessarily constitute an offense or
a situation where it would be reasonable to apply the degree of physical force of a PD. A PD would not be
used unless the person is engaged in some other readily apparent criminal behavior such as theft,
destruction of property, or assault.
EMPLOYMENT TECHNIQUES DURING FORCE PROTECTION AND
ANTITERRORISM OPERATIONS
5-23. PD teams contribute significantly to the military police force protection and antiterrorism effort. PDs
are directly responsible for executing specific security-related measures and for providing support to other
government agencies that contribute to force protection.
5-24. MWD support is accomplished under the leadership of the respective command PM. Force
protection is accomplished through an active role in physical security, HRP security, law enforcement, and
antiterrorism efforts. Force protection and antiterrorism operations consist of those actions that prevent or
mitigate hostile actions against DOD personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and
critical information. During force protection operations, offensive and defensive measures are coordinated
and synchronized to enable the joint force to perform while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
5-25. In operations, PD teams are used to enhance the detection capabilities of the combat support force
and to provide a psychological deterrent to hostile intrusions. If the PD teams are properly located in a
hostile environment, the PD's alert provides an initial warning to the presence of a hostile force. In past
combat operations, PD teams often provided warning of attacks early enough to allow a response force
time to deploy and to prevent enemy forces from reaching their objectives. PD teams have also helped
clear protected areas of hostile persons, explosives, and weapons after attacks.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 5-5

Chapter 5
Crowd Control in Kosovo
During Task Force Falcon (2A) in Kosovo, LTC Cloy (the battalion commander of
1-36 INF, 1 Bde, and 1AD) requested MWD support to assist the Alpha company
clear a main supply route (MSR) that had been blocked by 10,000 Kosvar Albanians.
LTC Cloy had already deployed both quick-reaction forces to assist Company A
because the crowd would not stay off the MSR. LTC Cloy called the battalion
operations center and directed that the MWD teams be sent to the scene.
SFC Barnes, SSG Rogers, SSG Barters, and SGT McClintock responded with their
dogs Queeny, Danny, Sandor, and Fedor and linked up with an infantry squad. The
MWD teams and infantry squad moved dismounted to the town of Gjilani. The crowd
was starting to become violent. LTC Cloy was in the middle of the crowd, standing in
the center of the city at the critical MSR intersection. LTC Cloy attached the MWD
teams to Company A. CPT Curtain, the company commander, told SFC Barnes to
move the crowd away from his area and to establish a perimeter. The MWD teams
moved into the diamond formation with the dogs on guard. Splitting the crowd in half,
the MWD teams moved through the crowd and reached the city center MSR
intersection in the center of the city. The handlers then used the dogs to move the
crowd back out of the road. Company A and the four MWD teams established a
perimeter line to keep the MSR open and traffic moving. They also apprehended
troublemakers in the crowd.
Later that evening when the dog handlers entered into the DFAC, LTC Cloy stood
up, gained everyone's attention, and stated, "SFC Barnes, you and your handlers
were like Moses. Your dogs parted the Red Sea!"
ACCESS CONTROL POINTS
5-26. A PD team may be used to enhance force protection and antiterrorism efforts at ACPs. The PD
team's function at an ACP is to deter unauthorized access, crime, and terrorism. The handler that is
assigned to the ACP should use the PD so that the public can observe and hear the dog. Care must be taken
to ensure that the handler constantly keeps the PD under control to prevent incident or injury to innocent
personnel.
BUILDING AND AREA SEARCHES
5-27. A PD team is especially effective in checking and searching buildings such as commissaries, post
exchanges, finance offices, banks, and warehouses. The PD team can check buildings visually while
patrolling and can stop and dismount so that the handler can physically check doors and windows. These
checks should be made with the PD on leash. To take maximum advantage of the PD's scenting ability, the
handler should approach buildings from downwind.
5-28. If a building is open or forced entry is evident, PD teams may be used to track hidden intruders from
the point of penetration to their location. PDs may be released to apprehend an intruder suspected of
committing a serious offense when the only alternatives are escape or the use of deadly force.
5-29. Prior to searching a building, the handler will determine whether to make the search with the PD on
or off leash. Some of the factors that must be considered include the following:
z Friendly forces or innocent bystanders in the area.
z The time of day or night.
z Evidence of forced entry.
z The type and size of the building or area to be searched.
z The danger to any innocent persons in the area.
z The PD's ability to work off leash.
z The threat level and IPB.
5-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Patrol Dogs and Characteristics
5-30. Prior to releasing the PD inside a building or enclosed area, the handler will give a clear voice
warning to any persons inside the building or in the area. They will be told to come out immediately and
that failure to comply with these instructions will result in the release of a trained MWD. An interpreter
may be needed to assist the PD team in giving the warning in the host nation language. All persons will be
warned that the PD may attack without warning and that they could receive physical injuries. The handler
maintains voice control of his PD throughout the search.
Note: A warning similar to the one for off-leash searches will precede on-leash searches. The
searching team should be followed by at least one other military policeman to protect the search
team.
APPREHENSION OF SUBJECTS
5-31. The use of PDs to attack and hold an individual enemy or terrorist should not be overlooked. A PD
can be sent into a building, confined space, or cave to find, attack, and hold an individual until the handler
and friendly forces can arrive to place the subject into custody. Although disadvantages do exist (injury or
death of the PD), the PD is better-suited than a human to immediately find and subdue a subject in an area
where the interior structure is unknown to friendly forces.
WALKING PATROLS
5-32. The PD team's contribution to MWD team law enforcement efforts is most effective when the team
is on foot. Some of the law enforcement duties that a PD team can do as a walking patrol include checking
or clearing buildings and patrolling parking lots, dependent housing areas, and troop billet areas.
5-33. Since it is easily seen, a PD used during daylight in congested areas provides a good psychological
deterrent to certain crimes. PDs are tolerant of people, and the presence of a large number of people does
not significantly reduce the PD's effectiveness except when conducting detection missions.
5-34. Using the PD team during darkness or periods of reduced visibility and in areas where there are
fewer distractions can enhance the PD's detection ability. Military police may not detect a person fleeing a
crime scene at night, but a PD will normally be able to detect and locate a fleeing suspect. When necessary
and appropriate, the PD is also much more effective at pursuing and holding the suspect.
5-35. Periodic use of PD teams around on–post schools, especially when school is starting and dismissing,
may help deter potential vandalism, child molestation, exhibition, and illegal drug activities. PD teams can
also provide effective security for communications facilities, military equipment, and command posts
(CPs).
ALARM RESPONSES
5-36. In responding to an alarm condition at facilities such as clubs, finance offices, or banks, the PD team
should be among the first military police on the scene. The PD team may be used to search and clear the
building and immediate area and help with any apprehensions. If the PD must be used to find a suspect,
other persons should attempt to avoid contaminating the area with scents or tracks that may confuse him.
VEHICLE PARKING LOTS
5-37. PD teams are effective in detecting and apprehending thieves and vandals in vehicle parking lots.
The presence of the PD team may deter potential acts of theft and vandalism. The PD team can be most
effective by alternating between vehicle and foot patrols of the parking lots. During hours of darkness,
when there is no activity in a parking lot, the PD team should approach the lot from the downwind side. If
the PD alerts, the handler should locate and challenge the suspect for identification.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 5-7

Chapter 5
5-38. If a suspect tries to escape or avoid apprehension and the handler is reasonably certain the suspect
has committed or is attempting to commit a serious offense, the handler should give a clear warning to the
suspect to halt. When lesser means of force have failed to stop the fleeing suspect, the PD may be released
to pursue, attack, and hold. If it is not safe to release the PD, the handler may attempt to follow the suspect
if the PD has the ability to track.

Chapter 6
Narcotics Detector Dogs and Characteristics
MWDs are trained to perform dual roles. In addition to the uses and characteristics of
the PD, the PNDD is trained to detect the odor and presence of specific drugs. This
specialized ability to detect certain illegal drugs makes the PNDD a valuable tool to
help commanders and other government agencies maintain law and order. The PNDD
can be employed in combat and/or force protection and antiterrorism operations
worldwide.
EMPLOYMENT FOR COMBAT SUPPORT OPERATIONS
6-1. The PNDD provides commanders with unique capabilities in combat support environments. The
narcotic detection capabilities of these dogs can be used to maintain the order and discipline of US soldiers
as well as combatants and other persons involved in operations (EPWs, CIs, refugees, or other
detained/interred persons [during time of war/conflict]). In addition to narcotic detection functions, PNDD
teams should not be overlooked for their PD functions as discussed in Chapter 5.
INTERNMENT AND RESETTLEMENT OPERATIONS
6-2. In addition to perimeter and other security duties, PNDD teams assigned to I/R camps can be used to
ensure that no illegal drugs are at the I/R camps by conducting searches of all areas. Commanders and
planners should consider having all inbound supplies or equipment searched by PNDD teams. Inbound and
outbound mail and vehicles should also be considered as a means for the movement of illegal drugs and, as
such, subject to a search by PNDD teams.
POSTAL OPERATIONS
6-3. Postal inspections, including mail storage areas and drop boxes, can be conducted in conjunction
with a military customs inspector (MCI) and according to DOD Directive 5030.49. The postmaster or MCI
can request PNDD support from the area PM or military police brigade S3 with coordination through the
KM team.
6-4. A PNDD team can be used to search mail that is received or shipped. Searches can be conducted as
the mail comes off or before it goes on the truck prior to being shipped. The PNDD team can search up and
down the conveyer belt as the mail is removed from or placed on the truck. If a conveyer belt is not being
used, the handler can instruct postal personnel how to arrange the mail in a secure area so that the PNDD
team can search it more effectively. When a PNDD team is used in the close quarters of a mailroom or
delivery area, all nonessential personnel should remain clear of the area while the team is actively working.
6-5. When the PNDD responds to a parcel indicating the possible presence of illegal drugs, the CID or
the military police investigations section will be notified for further action. At this point the PNDD team's
actions are finished.
AIRCRAFT AND LUGGAGE SEARCHES
6-6. Before beginning the search, ensure that all personnel have exited the aircraft and all compartments
are opened. The PNDD team searches the aircraft before searching any luggage or cargo. When
approaching the aircraft, conduct a fresh-air perimeter search from the downwind side. Once a perimeter
search has been conducted, the team boards the vessel at either the front or rear. Once the area has been
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 6-1

Chapter 6
cleared to search, the handler ensures that only one door is open to limit draft and wind current. A
systematic search of all areas within the aircraft is conducted from the top to the bottom. The handler
advises other military police on the scene where the PNDD displayed a positive response, and the
augmenting military police conduct a detailed search of the area surrounding the response.
6-7. When conducting inbound baggage inspections, the items should be aligned in a sterile area in rows
with at least six feet between rows. The handler conducts an on-leash search, presenting each piece of
baggage. When searching cargo, every effort should be made to search the cargo before it is palletized. The
cargo should be aligned in rows, with at lest six feet between rows, in a sterile area (same as baggage). The
handler conducts an on-leash search, presenting cargo as required. Once the PNDD team has searched the
cargo, it may be palletized while remaining in the sterile area prior to embarkation.
6-8. Conducting debarkation operations is the same as inbound operations. The host unit (to which the
cargo belongs or is being delivered) provides a representative (E6 or above) and a work detail to assist the
PNDD team. When pallets are removed from the aircraft, they are placed in a sterile area. Once in the
sterile area, the work detail unloads the pallets and arranges the cargo, as required by the PNDD handler.
FORCE PROTECTION AND ANTITERRORISM OPERATIONS
6-9. PNDD teams are extremely useful in force protection and antiterrorism operations. Commanders and
other government agencies use PNDD teams to protect the community from the harmful effects of illegal
drugs. PNDD teams protect the force and surrounding communities by deterring criminal activity and
enhancing law enforcement capabilities.
HEALTH AND WELFARE INSPECTIONS
6-10. PNDD teams conduct health and welfare inspections when requested by the commander and
coordinated through the KM, PMO, and S3. The commander contacts the KM directly to schedule a health
and welfare inspection. The KM, in conjunction with the installation PM, the CID special agent in charge,
and the military police investigations supervisor, briefs all levels of the command on the availability and
capabilities of the PNDD teams available to them on the installation.
6-11. When scheduling the inspection, the commander should have the following information available:
z The requested time of inspection.
z The areas to be inspected.
z The number of living quarters.
z The number and size of common areas.
z Other pertinent information.
Appendix H provides a guide to assist handlers with health and welfare inspections.
6-12. Once the coordinating instructions have been established, the KM coordinates a time and location to
brief the commander and demonstrate the PNDD team's capabilities. It is important that the unit requesting
the health and welfare inspection practices operational security (OPSEC) and informs only those personnel
who have an immediate need to know. This usually consists of the commander and first sergeant or
sergeant major. The KM advises the PM and the military police investigation supervisor when the
inspection is scheduled and if any additional support will be needed.
6-13. A systematic inspection of the living quarters and common areas is conducted. If the PNDD
responds to a locked wall locker, the soldier assigned to that wall locker is summoned to open it. Once the
wall locker has been opened, unit representatives conduct a detailed search of the wall locker and its
contents.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SCHOOLS AND DRUG ABUSE RESISTANCE EDUCATION
PROGRAM INSPECTIONS
6-14. KMs may receive requests from Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) officers or DOD school
principles to conduct a health and welfare inspection of a school. When conducting school inspections in
6-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Narcotics Detector Dogs and Characteristics
conjunction with DARE, basic building inspection techniques apply. The primary concern when inspecting
schools is the safety of the students and the secrecy of the search.
6-15. When possible, searches should be conducted in conjunction with a school activity, such as an
assembly or fire drill. This will allow the handlers to conduct the search with a decreased risk of student
involvement. Another option is to search the school after normal school hours or on a weekend or holiday.
In any event, the use of the PNDD team on school grounds must be cleared by the school administration
and the PM must be notified in advance.
ASSISTANCE TO MILITARY POLICE INVESTIGATIONS SECTION AND/OR THE DRUG
SUPPRESSION TEAM
6-16. The military police investigation section or the drug suppression team (DST) may contact the KM to
schedule an inspection for a number of reasons. PNDD teams may be requested to conduct an inspection of
a residence or building where illegal drugs have already been found. In addition, unit commanders may
request a PNDD team to inspect the quarters of a soldier who has shown a positive response on a
urinalysis. The PNDD is not used to verify or test a substance that has already been found. PNDD handlers
contact the military police investigations section or the DST in any circumstance that a PNDD has
responded positively according to local standard operating procedures (SOPs).
MILITARY CUSTOMS MISSIONS
6-17. The US Army has been designated as the proponent service for the military customs program.
According to current regulations, PNDD teams are used to inspect aircraft cargo areas and airframes when
the military customs inspector program manager (MCIPM) directs these inspections. When conducting
military customs missions, the handler should first inspect the vessel, then if deemed necessary by an MCI,
continue with baggage.
6-18. When scheduling military customs missions, the MCIPM coordinates with the KM according to
local SOPs. At a minimum, the MCIPM notifies the KM of—
z The requested time and date of the search.
z The number and types of vessels to be searched.
z The amount of cargo to be searched.
z The number of passengers and crew requiring the MCI's clearance.
z The determination on whether the search is a high-risk or selective search.
6-19. PNDD teams may inspect vessels such as military or civilian aircraft, boats or ships, vehicles, rail
cars, or any other vehicle capable of carrying passengers and/or cargo according to the military customs
program. These inspections are primarily conducted outside the continental United States. However, some
missions in the continental US may be necessary for units returning from foreign theaters where the
installation is their first stop within the customs territory of the United States. In addition, the military
customs program may require preclearance for units or individuals deploying to areas outside the customs
territory of the United States where an MCI has not yet been assigned or is not available. When conducting
preclearance of mobilized or deploying soldiers' personal baggage while in formation, the MCI must
ensure that the soldiers do not distract the PNDD team.
VESSELS, BAGGAGE, AND CARGO INSPECTIONS
6-20. When establishing sterile areas, the MCI coordinates with the PNDD handler and ensures that the
area is of sufficient size with minimal distractions to ensure the optimal working environment for the
PNDD. When scheduling working parties for embarkation or debarkation, the PNDD handler coordinates
with the MCI to ensure that sufficient personnel will be present to accomplish the mission in a timely
manner, but not so many soldiers that they might present a distraction to the PNDD. If an examination has
been deemed necessary by the MCI, the handler presents each piece of baggage or equipment to the
PNDD.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 6-3

Chapter 6
UNITED STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE MISSIONS
6-21. Missions in support of the USCS come from the MWD program manager via the KM. Handlers must
have—
z Active government credit cards.
z Current passports.
z Appropriate civilian attire (or a civilian clothing allowance).
z Complete transportation requirements.
6-22. When temporarily assigned to the USCS, local USCS agents, policies, and procedures direct the
PNDD team. Weapons are not authorized for handlers assigned to the USCS. The uniform of the day is
determined by the USCS and is normally civilian attire.
6-23. Prior to deploying, every attempt should be made to conduct pretraining exercises with the USCS.
These pretraining exercises will allow the MWD to acclimatize to larger quantities of contraband, which
may be found while on the mission. The USCS will provide large training aids and determine the PNDD
saturation point prior to deploying.
6-24. PNDD teams can expect to perform searches on aircraft, baggage, and tractor trailers as well as
vehicle lines at US borders. When assigned to the USCS, the handler does not conduct physical searches of
any kind. If the PNDD responds to an area, the handler advises a USCS agent and continues with the
search, leaving the agent to conduct the actual physical search of the area.
6-25. Tractor trailers are searched in a USCS sterile area. Once the cargo has been offloaded and placed in
standard lines, the PNDD team performs an exterior inspection of the vehicle before moving to all interior
compartments and concluding with a systematic search of the cargo.
6-26. While assigned to a US border, the PNDD may be employed in vehicle lines. Vehicle lines are
generally 10 to 20 vehicles in a row (placed bumper to bumper) that are inside a sterile area. The PNDD
team travels up one side of the vehicle line and back down the other. The handler presents all productive
areas. In the event that a USCS agent selects a vehicle for an individual vehicle inspection, that vehicle will
be placed in a sterile area and the driver will open all the compartments of that vehicle. Once all occupants
are clear of the vehicle, the PNDD will conduct a systematic inspection of the entire vehicle.
6-27. The PNDD will only be used in his narcotics detector role while deployed in support of the USCS or
other federal agency. The PD capabilities of the PNDD will not be used for any reason. If the handler is
instructed to use his PNDD in any method other than that of a narcotics detector dog, he must immediately
notify his KM.
PNDD Support to US Customs Counterdrug Missions
In the summer of 2003, SGTs Payne and Mason from Fort Knox, KY, and SPC
Johnson from Fort Sill, OK, were tasked to support a US Customs counterdrug
mission along the southwest border between Mexico and the United States. After an
overview and train up, the PNDD handlers and their assigned dogs went to work with
the customs agents to detect illegal drugs at various points of entry into the country.
These teams became very proficient in detecting large quantities of illegal drugs. The
PNDD teams detected narcotics in false floors, dashboards, gas tanks, seats, and
hidden panels of many vehicles.
After three months of searching vehicles at checkpoints, the PNDD teams were
responsible for detecting over 4,800 pounds of marijuana, over 95 pounds of
cocaine, and other undisclosed contraband.
6-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Narcotics Detector Dogs and Characteristics
RANDOM VEHICLE SEARCHES
6-28. The use of a PNDD at ACPs and installation gates can increase installation antiterrorism capabilities
by providing a visual deterrent to terrorist groups and other criminal elements. The installation commander,
task force commander, or base camp commander may task the PM to conduct random vehicle inspections
according to local SOPs and the FPCON. When this occurs, the PM submits a schedule of random vehicle
inspections to be conducted within a time frame that includes times, dates, and locations of inspections to
be conducted. The schedule will be approved or disapproved and the inspection parameters will be dictated
(will every vehicle be inspected or will vehicles be inspected at random according to the guidance
provided) by the commander and returned to the PM. The PM then notifies the KM accordingly and
provides him with a copy of the schedule with the commander's signature and inspection parameters. The
PNDD's patrol capabilities may be used at ACPs to search for stowaways and personnel trying to gain
access to the installation or a controlled area by hiding in delivery vehicles or other large cargo type
vehicles. Extreme caution must be used when using the team in this manner. The commander must be
aware that once the PNDD is given the command to search for personnel the MWDs aggression level will
increase, thus increasing the chances of the PNDD biting personnel.
ON-CALL DRUG RESPONSE
6-29. PNDD handlers will normally be placed in an on-call status. On call means the handler must remain
within response time and distance according to the local SOP. When on call, PNDD handlers do not
consume alcoholic beverages; however, they are in a duty position that allows them to wear appropriate
civilian attire as well as leave the post according to the local SOPs.
6-30. When on call, PNDD handlers maintain positive control of a secondary communication device
issued by the command. The secondary communication device may be a digital pager or cellular telephone
as determined by the command. When recalled, the PNDD handler returns to the kennel in the most
expedient legal manner to retrieve his PNDD. The PNDD will only be transported in an approved
government owned vehicle (GOV). At no time will an MWD be transported in a POV. The handler may
respond in appropriate civilian attire according to the local SOP.
6-31. KMs provide insight and guidance to the PM on technical matters of the SOP. The KM should
provide recommendations as to acceptable distances which may be traveled while on call, required
response times, the required secondary mode of communication, and any installation-specific items of
interest, such as an alternate uniform based upon the customary civilian attire that is prominent in the area.

Explosive Detector Dogs and Characteristics
In addition to the uses and characteristics of the PD, the PEDD is also trained to
detect the odor and presence of explosives. This specialized ability to detect
explosives makes the PEDD a valuable asset to help commanders and other
government agencies maintain law and order, while enhancing safety procedures.
PEDD teams can be employed in combat and/or force protection and antiterrorism
operations worldwide. PEDD teams are valuable assets. The task force commander,
the PM, and military police planners should consider the use of PEDD teams during
combat support operations. This chapter details sound employment techniques and
the capabilities of the PEDD teams that enable leaders to develop plans.
INTERNMENT AND RESETTLEMENT OPERATIONS
7-1. The Army is the DOD executive agent for all EPW/CI operations. The military police is tasked with
coordinating shelter, protection, accountability, and sustainment for I/R operations. The I/R function
addresses military police roles with US military prisoners, EPWs, CIs, refugees, or other detained persons
(during time of war/conflict). Although the combat support military police unit initially handles EPWs/CIs,
modular military police (I/R) battalions with assigned military police guard companies and supporting
MWD teams are equipped and trained to perform I/R operations for sustained amounts of time (see
FM 3-19.40).
7-2. PEDD teams may be used for searching internees' belongings or confinement cells. PEDD teams
should not be used to search a person. A PEDD is trained to attack with or without command; any sudden
movements the internee may make could be perceived by the PEDD as an aggressive act. Safety must
remain a priority for both the handler and military personnel.
7-3. The commander can also use PEDD assets to search the property of attached military personnel
when needed. This is especially helpful when new units are rotating or replacing old units. These types of
searches ensure that no explosives are taken out or brought in by US forces.
POSTAL OPERATIONS
7-4. Postal inspections, including mail storage areas and drop boxes, can be conducted in conjunction
with an MCI and according to DOD Directive 5030.49. The postmaster or MCI can request PEDD support
from the area PM or military police brigade S3 with coordination through the KM team.
7-5. The PEDD team can be used to search mail that is received or shipped. Searches can be conducted as
the mail comes off or before it goes on the truck prior to being shipped. The PEDD can search up and
down the conveyer belt as the mail is removed from or placed on the truck. If a conveyer belt is not being
used, the handler can instruct postal personnel how to arrange the mail in a secure area so that the dog can
search the mail more effectively. When a PEDD team is used in the close quarters of a mailroom or
delivery area, all nonessential personnel should remain clear of the area while the team is actively working.
7-6. When the dog responds to a parcel, indicating the possible presence of explosives, the area is
evacuated immediately. Military police secure the area and set up a temporary CP a safe distance from the
suspected explosives. Use the stand-off distance according to Appendix I, as applicable. Use the PEDD
team to search the safe area for any possible secondary explosives. Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)
personnel are requested to dispose of the explosives or render them safe. EOD personnel may give
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 7-1

Chapter 7
explosives and improvised explosive device (IED) components to federal agencies for further investigation
or turn over the scene to federal agencies after explosive hazards have been neutralized. The PEDD team
remains at the temporary CP and resumes detection operations once EOD personnel remove the explosives.
CHECKPOINTS AND ROADBLOCKS
7-7. PEDD teams can be used at checkpoints and roadblocks to supplement the control and movement of
vehicles, personnel, and materiel (Figure 7-1). PEDD teams are added to security forces to detect
explosives and to prevent illegal actions that may aid the enemy. Using these control measures deters
terrorist activities, saboteurs, and other threats.
Figure 7-1. Checkpoint Search
7-8. When using PEDD teams at hasty or deliberate checkpoints and roadblocks, a search area must be
designated for vehicles and a separate area must be designated for the vehicle occupants or any dismounted
personnel. The PEDD team conducts a search of the vehicle only after security forces at the checkpoint
ensure that all of the occupants have exited the vehicle and that a threat to friendly forces does not exist.
Security forces at the checkpoint provide overwatch while the PEDD team searches for explosives.
Note: At no time should a PEDD handler be used to search the interior of a vehicle. PEDD
handlers are trained on searching techniques with a PEDD and should not be used for security
force tasks.
7-9. In the event that the dog indicates the presence of explosives, the PEDD team withdraws
immediately from the vehicle. The area is evacuated and EOD personnel and the chain of command are
notified. The PEDD team stays behind a barrier at the safe-distance location in case the EOD team leader
requests further detector assistance. (See Appendix I for stand-off distances.)
Note: Be sure that radio operations are stopped until the PEDD team and security forces reach a
safe distance from the suspected explosives.
CORDON AND SEARCH OPERATIONS
7-10. Military police leaders and other task force commanders should consider using PEDD teams when
conducting cordon and search operations. PEDDs are trained and able to greatly improve the combat
force's success in uncovering hidden explosives and people.
7-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Explosive Detector Dogs and Characteristics
7-11. Once the military police or other security forces have established the cordon, the PEDD teams
should move in and operate with the search elements. During the search, the PEDD teams provide warning
of hidden explosives or persons while the rest of the search element employs overwatch and search
techniques.
7-12. The search element leader directs the actions of the team if people or explosives are detected. The
PEDD handler should be prepared to advise the commander on the capabilities of the dog and actions
required by the rest of the team to ensure the PEDD team's safety. It is important that all members of
cordon and search teams rehearse together before conducting operations.
FORCE PROTECTION AND ANTITERRORISM OPERATIONS
7-13. PEDD support for force protection and antiterrorism operations can be requested anywhere in the
world and in different circumstances. In forward deployed areas or hostile environments, PEDD teams are
often requested to ensure that any suspected explosives are detected before harm can come to US Army,
joint, and allied forces. In peacetime environments around the world, PEDD teams perform the detection
operations much the same as in combat support operations. The environment surrounding explosive
detection operations does not interfere with the explosive detection capabilities of the PEDD team.
SUSPICIOUS/UNATTENDED PACKAGE RESPONSES
7-14. Once a suspicious/unattended item that may contain explosives has been discovered, the military
police or security forces on the scene request a PEDD team. Normally, military police evacuate the area
and establish a CP a safe distance away from the threat using the stand-off distance listed in Appendix I of
this manual. The PEDD team checks the perimeter and secures the area for secondary explosives. EOD
personnel should respond to the scene and make contact with the PEDD team to be briefed on the location
of the package. The PEDD team moves to within 50 meters of the package and begins an area search up to
package. The PEDD team also scans the immediate area for secondary devices, when applicable.
Note: At no time should a PEDD team be used to search the package itself. EOD personnel
have received special training in handling suspicious/unattended packages and determining if a
suspicious/unattended package contains explosives.
7-15. A PEDD handler must not present, touch, open, or physically disturb a package that is suspected of
concealing explosives. Once the MWD team has discovered a suspicious item, EOD personnel assume
responsibility for the area and take control of the situation in order to render the package safe or dispose of
it as necessary.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 7-3

Chapter 7
PEDD Operations in Support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)
In April of 2003, SGT Raymond Rivera was performing explosives detection missions
with his PEDD Kevin in support of OIF near Baghdad, Iraq. SGT Rivera was
requested to sweep an area that a support element was in the process of clearing.
There was so much debris that a forklift was being used to move large amounts of
furniture and building supplies.
The PEDD team would search a portion of the area and then the forklift would come
in and haul off the debris searched. After the third load was hauled off, the dog
responded to a mattress on the ground with an office table on it. Expecting an
explosive devise, SGT Rivera notified the NCOIC of the detail and the area was
cleared of all personnel (to a safe distance) and secured. EOD personnel were
notified of the suspected explosives and responded to the scene.
SGT Rivera was standing by at the safe area while EOD personnel uncovered two
hand grenades that were buried in the sand just below the surface. SGT Rivera said,
"Even though it was only two grenades, I was amazed that Kevin found them under
all the debris. I'm glad we found them and not our soldiers."
BOMB THREATS
7-16. A PEDD team should be requested for assistance in detecting explosives whenever bomb threats are
made against persons or property for which the Army is responsible. The PEDD team's search for
explosives begins only after the area or building has been evacuated of all personnel and security has been
established. EOD personnel only respond when a suspect item is found; they do not conduct or participate
in searches except in support of the USSS. EOD units place a team on standby once the unit is alerted of a
bomb threat. PEDD teams coordinate this with the local EOD unit prior to any operation.
7-17. The PEDD team, EOD personnel, and site leadership collaborate to resolve the situation at a nearby
CP (see Appendix I for stand-off distances). When PEDD teams are located on an installation, their use
must be included in the bomb threat planning guidance.
7-18. A systematic search by the PEDD team should include the assistance of a spotter to ensure safety and
accuracy. PEDD teams are to be used only to detect the possible presence of explosives.
WARNING:
At no time will the handler touch, open, or otherwise disturb a
possible explosive device. IEDs are easily disguised and can be
triggered to explode by motion, sound, light, heat, or remote
devices.
7-19. Handlers and spotters must not change or otherwise disturb anything in the search. If the lights or
any electric device are off or on, do not touch the switch until a thorough search is conducted.
7-20. Ensure that the handler and spotter are provided with available safety equipment including—
z A flack vest (in addition to body armor).
z Flashlights or helmet-mounted lights.
z Gloves.
z Safety goggles.
7-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Explosive Detector Dogs and Characteristics
WARNING:
Always keep track of how much time has elapsed when using a
PEDD team at bomb threat incidents. Sufficient time must be
maintained to ensure that the team exits the building or area well
before the announced or suspected detonation time.
7-21. If the PEDD responds to the presence of explosives, the PEDD handler and spotter note the location
and leave the area. EOD personnel then begin measures to render the device safe or remove it. On the
request of EOD personnel, the PEDD team may then continue the search until another suspected explosive
is found or until the area is cleared by EOD personnel.
7-22. If the search is 30 minutes or longer in duration, explosive training aids should be planted
periodically so that the dog can find them. This helps to keep the dog interested in the search. Training aids
should only be planted in areas that have already been searched by the PEDD team.
HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL SEARCHES
7-23. Military police provide the task force commander with valuable area security capabilities to protect
C2 headquarters, equipment, and services essential for mission success. HRP security is an important task
within the area security function. PEDD teams may be employed to enhance explosive detection and
protection capabilities.
7-24. The KM or plans NCO determines which PEDD teams will perform the mission. The number of
PEDD teams for any mission is determined by the threat, the number of PEDD teams available, any
conflicting missions, and other environmental considerations noted in Chapter 8.
7-25. PEDD teams may be used as part of a combined arms operation or as an element of a larger security
force. When used as part of a combined arms team, the PEDD teams need to be involved will all troop-
leading procedures, including rehearsals. All personnel must have a complete understanding of the mission
in order to create a safe and secure environment for the HRP. The PEDD teams provide explosive detection
and personnel detection capabilities. PEDDs are also a deterrent to hostile forces or terrorists operating
within the area of operations.
7-26. Prior to an HRP visit to an area, the PEDD team assists with force protection actions by searching
for explosives and IEDs. PEDD also conduct searches of and provide security for outer perimeter areas.
During HRP operations, the handler—
z Briefs the on-scene commander of the dog's capabilities.
z Communicates with EOD personnel.
z Obtains the HRP's itinerary and determines locations to be searched.
z Requests a spotter or helper to assist.
z Ensures that areas are secure after searches are done.
z Informs the commander of results and continues follow-on missions.
ACCESS CONTROL POINTS
7-27. Using PEDD teams at ACPs can increase an installation's or base camp's force protection and
antiterrorism capabilities by providing a visual deterrent to terrorist groups and other criminal elements.
The PM notifies the KM of the requirement to perform vehicle searches at ACPs.
7-28. In the event that the PEDD detects the presence of suspected explosives, the military police forces at
the ACP secure and evacuate the area (see Appendix I for stand-off distances). EOD personnel are then
notified to render the item safe or remove it. PEDD handlers do not attempt to remove or otherwise disturb
any suspected explosives.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 7-5

Chapter 7
7-29. PEDD team patrol capabilities may be used at ACPs to search for stowaways and personnel trying to
gain access to the installation or a controlled area by hiding in delivery vehicles or other large cargo type
vehicles. Extreme caution must be used when utilizing the team in this manner. The commander must be
aware that once the PEDD is given the command to search for personnel the potential for injury exists.
HEALTH AND WELFARE INSPECTIONS
7-30. PEDD teams conduct health and welfare inspections when requested by the commander and
coordinated through the KM, PMO, and S3. The commander contacts the KM directly to schedule a health
and welfare inspection. The KM, in conjunction with the installation PM, the CID special agent in charge,
and the military police investigations supervisor, briefs all levels of the installation command on the
availability and capabilities of the PEDD teams available to them.
7-31. When scheduling the inspection, the commander should have the following information available:
z The requested time of the inspection.
z The areas to be inspected.
z The number of living quarters.
z The number and size of common areas.
z Other pertinent information.
Appendix H provides a guide to assist handlers with health and welfare inspections.
7-32. Once the coordinating instructions have been established, the KM coordinates a time and location to
brief the commander and demonstrate the PEDD's capabilities. It is important that the unit requesting the
health and welfare inspection practice OPSEC and inform only those personnel who have an immediate
need to know. This usually consists of the commander and 1SG or sergeant major. The KM advises the PM
and the military police investigations supervisor when the inspection is scheduled and if any additional
support is needed.
7-33. A systematic inspection of the living quarters and common areas is conducted. If the PEDD responds
to a locked wall locker, the soldier assigned to that wall locker is summoned to open it. Once the wall
locker has been opened, unit representatives conduct a detailed search of the wall locker and its contents.
AIRCRAFT AND LUGGAGE SEARCHES
7-34. Before beginning the search, ensure that all personnel have exited the aircraft and that all
compartments are opened. The PEDD team should search the aircraft before searching any luggage or
cargo. The PEDD team conducts a fresh-air perimeter search from the downwind side when approaching
the aircraft. Once a perimeter search has been conducted, the team boards the aircraft at either the front or
rear. Once the area has been deemed clear, the handler ensures that only one door is open to limit draft and
wind current. A systematic search of all areas within the aircraft is conducted from the top to the bottom.
7-35. If the dog alerts the handler to a possible presence of explosives, military police or security forces
evacuate and secure the scene. The PEDD team moves a safe distance away from the suspected explosives
but remains available to further assist EOD personnel, if requested. Once EOD personnel clear the area, the
PEDD team may resume the search until another suspected explosive is found or until the area is cleared
by EOD personnel.
7-36. When conducting inbound baggage inspections, the items should be aligned in a sterile area in rows
with at least six feet between them. The handler should conduct an on-leash search, presenting each piece
of baggage. When searching cargo, every effort should be made to search the cargo before it is palletized.
The cargo should be aligned in a sterile area in rows with at least six feet between them (the same as
baggage). The handler should conduct an on-leash search, presenting cargo as required. Once the PEDD
team has searched the cargo, it may be palletized while remaining in the sterile area prior to embarkation.
7-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Explosive Detector Dogs and Characteristics
7-37. Conducting debarkation operations is the same as inbound operations. The host unit (to which the
cargo belongs or is being delivered) provides a representative (E6 or above) and work detail to assist the
PEDD team. When pallets are removed from the aircraft, they are placed in a sterile area. Once in the
sterile area, the work detail unloads the pallets and arranges the cargo as required by the PEDD handler.

Chapter 8
Veterinary Support
At most locations, veterinary support is provided by an assigned Army VCO. When
there is no assigned VCO, an attending VCO from a nearby military installation is
assigned responsibility for providing veterinary support. The Army provides
veterinary support for all MWDs as authorized by DOD Directive 6400.4 and
ARs 40-1, 40-3, and 40-905. Emergency, civilian veterinary support is authorized for
MWDs when there is not a VCO available and/or care is beyond the capability of the
veterinary treatment facility (VTF). The responsible VCO and Army Veterinary
Service chain of command are responsible for establishing standard procedures for
approval, provision, and payment for emergency, civilian veterinary support.
VETERINARY RESPONSIBILITIES
8-1. The US Army Surgeon General provides professional veterinary support for the entire MWD
program through the Army Veterinary Corps. This responsibility includes—
z Medical and surgical care at training facilities, bases, and installations.
z Inspections to ensure that the kennel facilities are sanitary.
z A professional review of plans for new construction and modification of kennels, support
buildings, and sites.
z Prescribing an adequate feeding program.
z Instructing handlers and supervisors in all matters related to the health of MWDs.
z Conducting research to improve the MWD program.
8-2. The responsible VCO provides treatment for the diseased or injured MWD at the kennel site or at the
installation VTF. The Army Veterinary Corps is responsible for equipping this facility and for providing
medical and surgical supplies. The VCO is responsible for the MWD veterinary treatment record (VTR)
and related information about examinations, immunizations, and treatment.
8-3. The VCO instructs handlers about dog health, care, feeding, and first aid. This instruction helps the
handler to develop a better understanding of the MWD's health needs and improves the handler's ability to
care for the MWD. The VCO prescribes an appropriate feeding program based on the MWD's health, the
climate, and working conditions.
8-4. The VCO is involved in the review of all plans for new kennel construction or kennel modifications.
This ensures that potential health and safety hazards can be corrected before construction begins.
VETERINARY INSPECTIONS
8-5. At least quarterly, the VCO inspects the MWD kennel facility to make sure that proper sanitary
standards are being maintained. It is recommended that an animal care specialist conduct a monthly check
of the kennels to ensure that no major safety violations are present. The VCO ensures that insect and rodent
control efforts are adequate and that the handlers are properly maintaining the general health of the MWD.
The quarterly inspection also includes the following elements:
z An examination of the kennel facilities for safety hazards and distractions that may interfere
with the rest and relaxation of the MWDs.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 8-1

Chapter 8
z A review of the adequacy of the kennel structure (particularly for environmental conditions) and
feeding and watering schedules. The VCO should make recommendations to help prevent
disease and injury.
z A review of kennel sanitation and cleaning procedures and MWD food storage procedures to
minimize the risk of disease transmission to the MWD.
MANDATORY TRAINING
8-6. The local VCO is required to provide training to the MWD handlers upon initial assignment and at
least annually thereafter. More frequent training of handlers is recommended but not required. The
Department of Defense Military Working Dog Veterinary Services (DODMWDVS) recommends that
handler training be conducted at least quarterly. Topics include the following:
z Procedures on when and how to obtain veterinary support (an SOP is appropriate for this).
z General animal health.
z Grooming.
z Prevention of environmental injury (such as heatstroke or cold injuries).
z Emergency first aid (for bloat [gastric dilatation-volvulus], heat stroke, snake bites, and cold
injuries).
z Administration or application of routine medications.
z Proper MWD feeding.
z Feed sanitation (proper storage, preparation, and cleanup).
z MWD chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives protective
measures.
8-7. It is best to schedule mandatory training so that seasonal problems are addressed prior to their
occurrence and appropriate refresher training is provided prior to a deployment. This training is not meant
to turn handlers into animal health technicians, but to give them the tools needed to provide emergency
care until they can acquire veterinary support.
WEIGHT CHECKS
8-8. Each month the MWDs body weight must be recorded and sent to the responsible VCO. The KM
may communicate this to the VTF. Body weight is also measured and recorded monthly in order to monitor
body condition and detect important trends in weight loss or gain that may indicate illness. The KM and/or
handler documents data such as food intake, stool consistency, and vomiting in the monthly records.
RECORDS/HEALTH CERTIFICATES
8-9. VTRs are maintained by the local VTF. It is very important that MWD handlers ensure that all health
information is annotated in these records.
8-10. An examination is given just before shipping an MWD from one installation to another. The MWDs
are examined to detect injury or disease and to support the safe shipment and continued good health and
performance of the MWD. A health certificate is issued for the state or country into which the MWD is
being shipped for TDY and must accompany the MWD. When the TDY period exceeds 10 days, a health
certificate may be required for the MWD's return to his home station. A VCO signs this certificate no more
than 7 days prior to reembarkation. If the TDY location is in a different Army VCO's area of operation, the
gaining VCO is notified prior to the MWD's departure from the home station. An examination is given as
soon as possible, but not more than 10 days after the arrival of an MWD at a new assignment, TDY, or
deployed location and within 3 days of the MWD's return to his home station. It is important that the
handler who deployed with the MWD is present for the examination so that the VCO can get accurate and
complete information on any health issues while the MWD was deployed.
8-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Veterinary Support
FEEDING AND FOOD CONTROL
8-11. MWDs require a diet that is significantly different from that of pet dogs. Their work demands much
higher levels of energy and larger quantities of essential nutrients. The standard high-performance diet,
contracted and supplied by the GSA for MWDs, meets these nutritional needs and is the only approved
feed unless otherwise directed by the attending veterinarian.
8-12. Special diets may be procured and fed to individual MWDs when the VCO determines that other
than the standard diet is required. Normally, these diets are available from the VTF, but the MWD unit is
responsible for procurement costs.
8-13. Some MWDs have been trained using a food reward schedule that also requires special food. Food
reward is used only if an MWD fails to respond to any other type of reward. Procure the special food
through normal supply channels or authorized local purchase. The amount of food each MWD should be
fed depends on his weight, the amount of activity, and the climate. Local VCOs determine the proper
amounts to feed. The responsible VCO must be told when an MWD is trained using food.
8-14. The VCO also prescribes the time of day each MWD is to be fed. This depends on the MWD's duty
schedule and the schedule of other kennel activities. MWDs should be allowed 2 hours to eat; leftover food
is disposed of within another two hours and feeding pans are cleaned and put away. Never leave uneaten
food in the kennel past the authorized 2-4 hour feeding period. If the MWD finishes his meal prior to the
end of the feeding period the feed pan may be removed.
PARASITE CONTROL
8-15. MWDs are at risk of becoming infested with internal parasites (intestinal worms and heartworms),
and external parasites (fleas, ticks, and mange). Some of these parasites may also transmit infectious
diseases to the MWD. In order to prevent infestation and disease transmission, all MWDs must be on a
routine parasite prevention program supervised by the responsible veterinarian. At a minimum, this must
include the administration of a monthly oral (pill or chewable) heartworm preventative and internal
parasite preventive and the administration of a topical, veterinary-prescribed external parasite preventative
against fleas and ticks.
8-16. When deployed to areas with high parasite risk, additional preventive measures such as prescription
flea and tick collars and the oral antibiotic doxycycline will be prescribed by the supporting veterinarian.
Doxycycline must be given with food. The handler must ensure that adequate supplies of all preventives
are issued by the VTF prior to departing for TDY or deploying. Flea and tick collars will only be used
when prescribed by the veterinarian and must be removed when the MWD is not under direct physical
control (when off the choke chain and leash) of the handler to prevent accidental ingestion.
FOOD STORAGE
8-17. Food should be stored in a sealed container that will not allow contamination or rodents to enter the
food (for example, pail, utility 7 gallon, NSN 7240-01-411-0581). Bulk storage of food must be in an area
separate from the storage of other equipment, cleaning supplies, or materials that may contaminate the
food. Bags should be elevated 4-6 inches above the ground, and neatly stacked with a 4-inch space
between the stacks and the walls. The sanitation standards for the storage of MWD rations are identical to
those required for the storage of bulk rations for personnel in a troop issue subsistence activity, exchange,
or commissary.
DEPLOYABILITY CATEGORIES
8-18. The purpose of reporting MWD deployability status is to assist the MWD program managers, PM,
commanders, and KMs with the selection of MWD teams for deployment and TDY and to rapidly identify
MWDs with limited duty requirements. These guidelines take medical and physical fitness factors into
consideration including—
z The anticipated MWD duty stress at deployed locations compared to the home location.
z The availability of veterinary support at the deployed location.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 8-3

Chapter 8
z The climate and environment of the deployed location.
z Any diagnosed or suspected medical conditions that may affect the MWD's performance.
z The MWD's physical conditioning and stamina as observed by the KM and handler.
8-19. It should be noted that some determinations are and will remain subjective; thus the need for prudent
judgment by all individuals involved in these assessments remains. This is particularly true regarding the
effect of age on an individual MWD. Old age is not a disease and MWDs are not downgraded just due to
age; however, with increased age comes increased incidence of illness or disability. These problems may
warrant a change in deployability status.
8-20. Deployability status is initially determined after the VCO examines the MWD at the receipt physical
or semiannual physical exam. The KM determines training and proficiency status. The VCO and KM
should discuss their findings and then categorize each MWD's status and forward the listing through the
KM to the PM and MWD program manager. Updates to deployability status lists are performed at least
monthly or as needed as changes occur in an individual MWD's status.
Category 1—Unrestricted Deployment (Both Outside the Continental United States and in the
Continental United States)
8-21. The MWD is medically fit for any contingency or exercise. There are no limiting or compromising
factors. Medical factors may exist but will not limit performance. Special diets, controlled drugs, or special
medications can be sent with the MWD (or be carried by the handler) in a quantity sufficient to last the full
duration of the anticipated deployment.
Category 2—Limited Deployment (Continental United States or Home Theater of Operation)
8-22. The MWD is medically fit for regions and missions with a minimal requirement for acclimation to
heat or physical stress where complete veterinary support is available. The MWD is fit for short duration
deployments. There are no significant limiting or compromising factors. Medical problems may exist
which slightly limit performances but are controllable. Special diets or medications are required; however
they are available in the deployed location or can be sent with the MWD. The reason for limited
deployability must be reported.
Category 3—Temporarily Nondeployable
8-23. A medical condition exists that impedes daily duty performance and is under diagnosis, observation,
or treatment. The MWD may still be allowed to work at the home station but in a limited capacity.
Category 4—Permanently Nondeployable
8-24. An unresolved medical or physical problem exists that frequently or regularly impedes daily duty
performance and an early retirement date cannot be given. The reason for nondeployability must be
reported. Medical or physical conditions warrant replacement within one year. The responsible veterinarian
and KM should initiate an MWD disposition process at the time an MWD is declared category 4.
KENNEL SANITATION PROCEDURES
8-25. Cleanliness is one of the most important factors for the good health of an MWD. The KM must
enforce sanitary measures in and around the kennel area. A good standard of sanitation is the result of the
cooperation of the handlers, KMs, supervisors, and the VCO.
8-26. The VCO and the PM or military police commander should set the standard of sanitation. This
standard must be maintained by each of the handlers and the KM.
8-27. Kennels must be sanitary, in a good state of repair, and thoroughly cleaned every day. Kennels
should be disinfected at least once every week using only those disinfecting products approved by the
VCO. Kennels should also be disinfected whenever an animal is removed from a kennel so that the kennel
will be ready to be occupied by another animal.
8-4 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Veterinary Support
8-28. Stool must be removed from the runs as often as necessary as but no less than twice daily to prevent
the MWD from becoming dirty. The method of disposing of stool depends on local conditions and the type
of sewage system present. If stool must be carried from the area in cans, the cans must be cleaned and
disinfected after each use.
8-29. The entire kennel area must be free of refuse and garbage that could attract rats and insects.
Mosquito control measures must be used in ditches and swampy areas in the vicinity of the kennels.
Disinfectants and disinfectant procedures should be used only with the approval of the VCO.
MEDICATION
8-30. At times, a VCO prescribes special medication (to be given separately or mixed with food) for a sick
or injured MWD. The handler must know how to administer these medications in both pill and liquid form.
8-31. When any foreign substance is placed directly into a dog's mouth, his first reflex is to spit it out. The
handler must learn how to administer medication properly so that the MWD is forced to swallow. With the
VCO's approval, pills or liquids can be mixed with a small amount of canned dog food or other soft food
and fed to the MWD. To administer capsules or tablets—
z Place the fingers of your left hand over the MWD's muzzle and insert your left thumb under the
lip and between his upper and lower teeth right behind the canine tooth, pressing your left
thumb against the roof of his mouth to open it.
z Place the capsule or tablet into the MWD's throat at the extreme rear of the tongue to prevent
him from spitting it out. Quickly remove your hand, close the MWD's mouth, and gently
massage his throat until he swallows. The entire procedure must be quick and smooth to ease the
MWD's apprehension and resentment.
8-32. Liquid medication is best administered with the help of another person. The handler—
z Holds the MWD's upper and lower jaws together with his left hand. The assistant pulls the
MWD's lips away from the teeth at one corner of the mouth with his right hand. The MWD's
nose is then pointed slightly upward, forming a natural funnel by the lip, and the assistant pours
the liquid into this funnel.
z Elevates the MWD's head only slightly above the horizontal when giving liquid medicine. If the
MWD's head is raised higher, he has difficulty in swallowing. Give the MWD adequate time for
swallowing to prevent the liquid from getting into the trachea, nose, or lungs. Use extreme
caution in giving oily liquids.
z Allows the MWD to lower his head and rest before proceeding if any signs of distress, such as
coughing or struggling, appear. Do not give oral medications or any liquids if the MWD is
unconscious or cannot swallow.
FIRST AID
8-33. Normally, the handler's early recognition of symptoms of illness or injury allows sufficient time to
get assistance from a VCO. However, situations may arise when medical help is not immediately available.
The seriousness of the incident may require that the handler take emergency actions to protect the life or
health of the MWD. The first aid instructions that follow are commonly used to save life, prevent further
injury, and reduce suffering from pain. In all emergency situations, notify the VCO as soon as possible so
that the MWD can receive professional medical attention.
8-34. First aid kits should always be available in the kennel area and at training sites. The handler should
also carry a first aid kit as part of his or her equipment for the MWD on all operational missions. The VCO
will determine the contents of first aid kits. When items are used from the first aid kit, they should be
replaced with new items immediately.

Chapter 8
MUZZLES
8-35. When an MWD has been injured, the first consideration is to calm and immobilize the animal. Pain
and distress, however, may cause the MWD to respond to the handler in an unpredictable manner. The
MWD may not respond to verbal commands and may attempt to bite the handler and anyone helping the
handler. Whether to apply a muzzle (Figure 8-1) or not depends on the nature of the emergency. If the
MWD is unconscious, shows any difficulty in breathing, or has suspected head injuries, a muzzle should
not be used. Otherwise, a muzzle should be used for safety.
Figure 8-1. Muzzle Use
8-36. There are several types of muzzles, but the leather basket muzzle is the best and most comfortable. It
allows for free breathing and causes the least alarm and apprehension. The MWD can still inflict a wound
while wearing this type of muzzle, so caution is required.
8-37. An improvised muzzle can be made using the MWD's leash and is called a leash muzzle. To apply
the leash muzzle, tighten the choke chain on the MWD's neck by pulling the leash tightly with the right
hand. Place the left hand, palm up, under the choke chain on the neck. Grasp the leash tightly as it passes
through the palm of the left hand, wrap the leash once around the MWD's neck, and bring it up and across
the left side of his head. Finally, wrap the leash twice around the muzzle and grab it tightly with the left hand.
CAUTION
The leash muzzle may be used when the leather muzzle is not
available or when it would not provide adequate safety. Do not use the
leash muzzle when the MWD is overheated, is having difficulty
breathing, or is indicating that he may vomit. Do not leave it on for long
periods in hot weather.
FRACTURES
8-38. If a fracture occurs, restrain the MWD and encourage it to lie down and remain quiet. If the face and
jaw are not injured, put the MWD in a loose muzzle. Notify the veterinarian immediately when a fracture
occurs or is suspected. If there is any bleeding, treat the MWD according to paragraph 8-40, then proceed
with splinting and moving the MWD to the veterinarian if he is not immediately available.
8-39. Prior to moving the MWD, the fracture area needs to be immobilized with a splint. This should be
possible for most leg fractures. The leg should be splinted in the same position it is placed by the MWD
8-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Veterinary Support
when it is hurt. Do not try to straighten or reduce the fracture. Splinting an MWD's leg is similar to
splinting a soldier's leg and may be done with the same materials: bandages, torn cloth, splints from the
medic's bag, or other available material including sticks, boards, and rolled newspaper. After the leg is
splinted, or if the fracture cannot be splinted, gently move the MWD onto a litter or improvised litter, such
as a piece of plywood, or into a kennel and carry it to a vehicle for transport. It is best to slide the litter
under the MWD rather than lifting the MWD onto the stretcher. The MWD may need to be strapped to the
litter to allow safe movement. Make sure to support the injured leg or area during movement.
BLEEDING WOUNDS
8-40. Bleeding must be quickly controlled, particularly wounds in the foot or leg that are prone to bleed
freely. Applying pressure directly on the wound may control bleeding; use a sterile bandage or clean
handkerchief or pinch the edges of the wound with your fingers. As soon as possible, apply a pressure
bandage.
BURNS
8-41. Most burns occur when an animal comes into contact with hot water, grease, tar, or other scalding
liquids. MWDs may also get electrical burns by chewing electrical wires. If an MWD is trapped in a
burning building, it may suffer from smoke inhalation in addition to surface burns. The handler can prevent
all of these situations through positive control of the MWD. If a burn does occur, applying cold-water
soaks or ice packs to the burn for approximately 20 minutes may treat minor burns. The cold helps to
reduce the pain. The hair around the burn should be clipped away and the burn should be washed gently
with a surgical soap. Blot it dry with sterile or clean soft gauze or cloth. Protect the burned area from
rubbing by applying antibiotic ointment and a loose fitting gauze dressing.
SHOCK
8-42. An animal may go into shock after injuries to internal organs, excessive bleeding, or trauma. Shock
can be recognized by the following symptoms:
z A glassy look to the eyes.
z A rapid or weak pulse or rapid shallow breathing.
z A dropping body temperature. The lips and feet may feel cold.
z A paleness of the membranes of the mouth and eyes.
z Slow capillary refill time. To determine capillary refill time, press firmly against the MWD's
gums until they turn white. Release the pressure and count the number of seconds until the gums
return to their normal color. If it is more than two to three seconds, the MWD may be going into
shock. Failure to return to the red-pink color at all indicates that the MWD may be in serious
trouble and needs immediate assistance.
8-43. If a handler suspects that an MWD has internal injuries or is going into shock, request help from a
VCO immediately. Keep the MWD warm and quiet, and lower his head to prevent possible brain damage.
If it is necessary to move the MWD, use a litter. Administration of intravenous fluids by appropriately
trained personnel will help to prevent permanent injury from shock.
ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION
8-44. There are conditions that may cause an MWD to stop breathing. When this happens, do not panic.
Follow these procedures:
z Open the MWD's mouth and check for any obstructions. Extend the MWD's tongue and
examine his throat.
z Clear the MWD's mouth of any obstructions then, close his mouth, and hold it gently closed.
z Inhale, and then cover the MWD's nose and mouth with your mouth.
z Exhale gently. Do not blow hard. Carefully force air into the MWD's lungs and watch for his
chest to expand. Repeat every five to six seconds or at a rate of 10 to 12 breathes per minute.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 8-7

Chapter 8
SNAKEBITES
8-45. The bite of a poisonous snake can cause serious illness and death if not treated immediately. Keep
the MWD quiet and calm, and request veterinary assistance or move the MWD as quickly as possible to a
treatment facility. Panic or exertion causes snake venom to move more rapidly through the bloodstream. If
possible, kill the snake so it can be shown to the VCO. The handler should be careful not to be bitten by
the snake or come into contact with the snake venom. Bites may occur on the face or neck of the MWD.
When this happens, remove the choke chain and loosen or remove the collar and muzzle. Swelling occurs
rapidly after a snakebite, and this equipment may restrict breathing. Position the MWD's head extended
from his body to allow him to get maximum airflow. An ice pack applied to the bite area helps to slow the
flow of blood and helps to keep the venom from spreading.
CAUTION
A tourniquet should not be applied. Constricting the blood flow could
increase tissue death.
FOREIGN OBJECTS IN THE MOUTH
8-46. An MWD may get a stick or other foreign object stuck in his mouth or throat. The most common
foreign object that becomes stuck is a Kong® or ball reward that is too small for the MWD. The MWD
may cough, gag, have difficulty swallowing or breathing, paw at the mouth, and drool. If the MWD is
having difficulty breathing, cautiously and gently open his mouth. Look for any abnormal object in the
throat, under the tongue, between the teeth, in the gums, or in the roof of the mouth. If the MWD is having
trouble breathing, removing the object is an emergency. The ball, Kong, or other object can be removed
using pliers or clamps. If the object is not causing breathing problems, it is best to leave it in place and get
veterinary assistance.
POISONOUS SUBSTANCES
8-47. There are many toxic chemicals an MWD may come in contact with and/or ingest. These include
insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, and antifreeze. The symptoms of poisoning vary. Unless the handler
is certain the MWD has eaten a poison, do not treat for poison. Occasionally, MWDs accidentally swallow
narcotics or explosives training aids. Exposure to poisons and accidental ingestion of training aides should
be prevented by positive control of the MWD by the handler. If the handler knows that the MWD has eaten
a poison, narcotic, or explosive, take the following actions:
z Request veterinary assistance immediately.
z Determine the type and quantity of poison, chemical, narcotic, or explosive that has been
swallowed. If any part of the substance or container is available, keep it for the VCO to examine.
z If the Army VCO is not available, immediately make contact with a civilian veterinary to
determine if vomiting is appropriate. Causing an animal to vomit is not recommended in all
types of poisoning as it may cause more harm to the animal. When vomiting is appropriate, the
animal may be induced to vomit by giving him one-quarter to one-half of a cup of hydrogen peroxide.
z Keep the MWD quiet and warm until the VCO arrives.
8-48. For future reference, keep a copy of the material safety data sheet for any training aide that may be
ingested available. MWD first aid should be according to the material safety data sheet for people.
OVERHEATING
8-49. Overheating results when an MWD is unable to eliminate body heat rapidly enough. This condition
requires immediate action by the handler to save the MWD's life. During hot, humid weather, an MWD
may easily become overheated during training, during operations, or while being transported. A body
temperature of 105° Fahrenheit or more, combined with poor response to commands, weakness, unsteady
8-8 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Veterinary Support
movement, vomiting, difficult or labored breathing, convulsions, and collapse are all symptoms of
overheating. It is helpful to take the MWD's temperature in order to monitor the severity of overheating
and progress in cooling, but temperature alone does not determine the need for or method of treatment.
8-50. For mild to moderate heat injury, the MWD's temperature is generally lower than 104° Fahrenheit.
The MWD may have mild symptoms, to include uncontrolled panting, a rapid but somewhat weak pulse,
mild to moderate difficulty breathing (but not cyanotic [blue]), and exercise intolerance or loss of stamina.
This is equivalent to heat exhaustion in people.
8-51. When the symptoms of overheating occur, loosen the leash, collar, and muzzle as much as possible
without loosing control of the MWD. This allows for more efficient panting and cooling. Follow these
guidelines at the onset of symptoms:
z Carry the MWD to the nearest shade and fan him if no wind is present.
z Try to quickly lower the MWD's body temperature by running and sponging cool water over the
MWD's head, body, and legs. If a body of water is available, allow the MWD to stand in the
water but make sure the MWD's head remains above water. Running water works better than
standing water.
z Place the MWD in an air-conditioned kennel, vehicle, or shelter.
z Apply ice packs to the MWD's groin, armpits, and head to increase speed of cooling.
z Dampen, but don't soak, the MWD's feet, ears, and abdomen with rubbing alcohol. Allow it to
evaporate and then reapply more.
z Do not let the MWD over drink. He should not consume more than one cup of water until he is
calm and his temperature returns to normal.
z Monitor the MWD's temperature every 5-10 minutes, and stop cooling efforts when it reaches
100-103° Fahrenheit. Keep monitoring his temperature for an additional 60 minutes.
8-52. If the MWD's temperature remains normal (about 100-103° Fahrenheit), treatment is complete;
however the MWD must be examined by a VCO and a heat injury must be reported in his VTR. If his
temperature climbs again, restart cooling efforts.
8-53. If the MWD's temperature drops below 100° Fahrenheit, begin warming by drying and wrapping
him with sheets and blankets. Remove the heat when his temperature goes above 101° Fahrenheit.
8-54. For severe heat injuries, the MWD's temperature is generally over 104° Fahrenheit combined with
poor response to commands, weakness, unsteady movement, vomiting, difficult or labored breathing,
uncontrolled panting, convulsions, collapse, a dull or depressed attitude and behavior, a rapid but
somewhat weak pulse, exercise intolerance or loss of stamina, and cyanosis (blueness) or dark red mucous
membranes. This is equivalent to heatstroke in people. If this occurs take the following actions:
z Initiate all cooling and monitoring efforts as noted in paragraph 8-51.
z Administer 1 liter of intravenous fluids to the MWD as quickly as possible if appropriately
trained personnel are available.
z Continue cooling and monitoring until a veterinarian can evaluate the MWD.
BLOAT (GASTRIC DILATION-VOLVULUS)
8-55. Bloat is an acute stomach enlargement and twisting that may be due to gas, food, or water. It may
occur if the MWD is fed immediately before or after hard exercise or when he is returned to his kennel
after work or exercise and allowed to drink too much water.
8-56. An enlargement may be seen just behind the ribs, primarily on the left side. The MWD may also be
restless and show signs of pain in the abdominal region. He may attempt to vomit or have a bowel
movement. His breathing may be difficult or labored due to pressure from the enlarged stomach.
8-57. Handlers should notify the VCO and stop all watering and feeding. Walking may enable the MWD
to relieve himself through bowel movements or passing gas. Most cases require extensive treatment by the
VCO.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 8-9

Chapter 8
8-58. To prevent bloat, MWDs should not be fed within a two-hour period before or after hard work or
vigorous exercise. It is also safer to provide multiple small meals each day, feeding twice daily, rather than
one large meal. In hot weather, give small amounts of water during training or working MWDs to prevent
excessive thirst. For the first hour after working or training, only three inches of water in the bucket should
be available. After this cooling-off period, more water may be given.
FIRST AID KIT
8-59. The responsible VCO determines the contents of MWD first aid kits. The VCO should consider the
skill of the handlers, access to veterinary support, and emergency situations that may occur. The
DODMWDVS does not have a standard first aid kit supply list because needs vary. The local VCO and
KM are responsible for developing and putting together an appropriate kit and training the handlers how to
use it. The kit should contain supplies for cleaning and dressing minor wounds, cleaning and protecting an
eye injury, bandaging or splinting minor breaks, and removing mild superficial foreign bodies (splinters or
glass). It should also contain peroxide, antibacterial solutions, and a small supply of any prescription
medications needed for individual MWDs.
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE MILITARY WORKING DOG
8-60. Just as the environment affects soldiers performing their duties, the MWD is affected by his
surroundings. It is important for planners and leaders to become aware of the many different conditions
that can affect the performance of MWDs. Not all MWDs are affected in the same manner. Acclimation
times will vary between conditions and MWDs. Planning considerations should always include the VCO
when the MWD will be used or trained in environments that he is not accustomed to.
WIND
8-61. Always consider the direction and velocity of the wind when using an MWD for any detection
operations. This consideration holds true even indoors. There may be a slight breeze that will move a scent
away from the location of its source. Fans, air conditioning units, and objects in motion can create winds
that will affect the performance of a detector dog.
8-62. In addition to these operational concerns, wind may create medical issues (such as blowing sand)
that are negative. Wind also creates increased cooling, which is positive in hot weather but negative in cold
weather.
INCLEMENT WEATHER
8-63. Precipitation can degrade the MWD's performance of detection operations; however, do not assume
that an MWD will not be able to perform satisfactorily. The amount of moisture accumulated and the
amount of time elapsed since the scent was left are variables. MWDs have been proven to be effective even
in inclement weather. MWDs that become wet and are returned to their kennels or crates while wet are at
increased risk of skin injury and infection.
HEAT
8-64. When operating in locations of extreme heat, the MWD should be allowed sufficient time to
acclimate. Consult with the VCO at the location to determine how long an MWD should be allowed to
acclimate. Care should be given to ensure that the MWD does not sustain injuries to the pads of his paws
due to excessive walking on concrete or pavement in extreme heat conditions. Always ensure that the
MWD has a fresh and constant source of drinking water.
COLD
8-65. Extreme cold temperatures should not deter MWD operations. Special care should be taken to enable
an MWD to perform in cold locations. The accumulation of moisture on the MWD's paw pads can freeze
and injure him. Using paw pad protectors to aid in the prevention of injury due to cold weather may be
8-10 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Veterinary Support
helpful, but the MWD must be trained to wear them. The MWD should be allowed to rest and warm up on
the same cycle as the handler.
TERRAIN
8-66. The safety of the handler and MWD must be given the highest consideration when operating in
hazardous terrain. Care should be taken when employment will take place in rocky or mountainous areas.
Unfamiliar locations can pose threats in the form of caves, holes, loose footing, and other hazards.
Whenever possible, conduct a reconnaissance of the area before employing an MWD.
DISTRACTIONS
8-67. There are numerous distractions that can affect MWD operations. These are conditions that can
cause the MWD to focus his attention away from the desired task at hand. Planning and consideration
should be given to eliminate or reduce distractions that hinder operations. Distractions are natural and man-
made. Some examples of distracters are:
z Other dogs (both MWD and indigenous).
z Other animals.
z Human presence and activities.
z Noise.
z Smells.

Appendix B
Kennel Construction
This appendix is intended to be a starting point in the design process with the
identification of requirements and spaces. It should serve as a supplement to the
installation design guide and not as a replacement. This appendix provides
commanders and planners with guidelines and specifications to consider for the
construction and equipment of kennel facilities. The floor plan (Figure B-1) is an
example of how an MWD facility works, how areas relate to each other, and what is
required for each space. It is not intended to serve as a rigid model for duplication.
Figure B-1. Example of an MWD Kennel Floor Plan
TEMPORARY KENNELS
B-1. There are two major types of kennels, temporary (Figure B-2, page B-2) and permanent. According
to AR 190-12, temporary kennels are to be used during deployments for no longer than one year, to allow
sufficient time for permanent kennels to be built. Temporary kennels may be constructed out of any
available resources. The design is not standard and varies from site to site depending on the location,
mission, and duration of operations. Using a concept similar to constructing fighting positions, the
temporary kennels will be improved continuously as needed or until a permanent facility is completed.
B-2. Using tents and shipping crates may be a hasty method of setting up temporary kennels. Although
this method is not optimal for sustained operations, it may be useful until other accommodations can be
coordinated. Erect the tents at a location that allows the MWDs a safe place to rest away from other troop
activities after operations. Whenever possible, use terrain or buildings to place a barrier between troop
activity and the temporary kennel. Never place the temporary kennel site near motor pools, dining
facilities, or high noise areas.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 B-1

Appendix B
Figure B-2. Temporary Kennel
B-3. In some areas of operation, it may be possible to obtain the use of a building or other structures for
temporary kennels. In these cases, leaders must ensure that the building is well ventilated, safe, and
structurally sound. Ensure that there are no hazards (such as chemicals, bare wires, holes, or debris) that
can cause injury to the MWDs or handlers.
B-4. Engineers are often used to assist in the improvement of temporary kennels. In addition, fences
should be erected and dog runs created.
Note: From the start of operations, sanitation measures must be employed in all temporary
kennel configurations.
PERMANENT KENNELS
B-5. The following information and figures give specific details for the construction of a permanent
kennel facility and adjacent areas. These guidelines may be altered to allow for special needs or uses
unique to each location.
EXTERIOR AREAS
B-6. An MWD kennel complex (Figure B-3) consists of kennels, a support building, an obedience course,
an exercise area, an MWD break area, exterior storage, parking areas, drives, and walks. Often, as a result
of the location, utility services are limited at the site. Construction should provide the following utilities:
z Water (potable with backflow prevention).
z A sanitary sewer.
z Electric.
z Telephone.
z Network and communication service to the site.
Other systems should be incorporated according to local procedures.
B-7. The entire complex should be enclosed, at the minimum, with a heavy-duty, 8-foot-high chain-link
fence with three strands of straight wire (no barbed) at the top to prevent an MWD from climbing or
jumping out. A 10-foot (minimum) vehicle gate that can be padlocked is to be installed to allow for food
deliveries to the kennel and other access requirements. A personnel entry gate that is visible from the KM's
office is also required. The personnel gate should have a cipher lock and a notification buzzer that sounds
in the KM's office, the obedience course, and the kennel. The buzzer in the kennel should have the
capability to be turned on when personnel are in the area and turned off to allow the MWDs to rest when
personnel are absent. All gates should be self-closing and self-latching.
B-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Kennel Construction
Figure B-3. MWD Kennel Complex
B-8. Security lighting for the area should be according to local policy. At a minimum, the lighting should
be on from dusk to dawn and placed on all corners of the fencing area. Security lights should be placed in
areas that the other lights do not cover.
B-9. Warning signs will be posted on the exterior fencing and buildings of the MWD kennel and exercise
area. Signs should contain the following words: "DANGER—OFF LIMITS–MILITARY DOG AREA."
Personnel approaching the kennel area should be able to see and read the warning signs under normal
daylight conditions from a distance of 50 meters.
B-10. Locate a trash dumpster for the complex outside of the perimeter fence. Screen the dumpster and
provide low-maintenance landscaping for the complex according to local policy.
Exterior Storage, Parking Areas, Drives, and Walks
B-11. An enclosed, 400-square-foot exterior storage building is required to store maintenance equipment,
portable kennels, and obstacles. Interior/exterior lighting, power, and a water faucet should be included.
B-12. Staff parking should be a paved parking lot large enough for eight POVs, three GOVs, two visitor
vehicles, and one handicap parking space. Pave access drives to accommodate parking, exterior storage,
food deliveries, emergency vehicles, and the transportation of MWDs.
B-13. Provide paved walks to all areas. When designing, give careful consideration to creating a one-way
MWD traffic system. To prevent confrontations between the MWDs, avoid situations that allow MWDs to
meet head on.
Obedience Course (150 Feet by 150 Feet)
B-14. The obedience course plays an important role in maintaining the MWD's agility and stamina as well
as in reinforcing obedience and proficiency training. The course should be grassed and free of hazards
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 B-3

Appendix B
(trees, large rocks, holes, and burrs) that may be harmful to MWDs and handlers. The site should be graded
for drainage but minimally sloped to provide a level field for training. The area should be enclosed with an
8-foot chain-link fence. Gates should be self-closing and self-latching with a minimum width of 5 feet to
allow for lawn maintenance equipment. The area should be well lighted to eliminate shadows. Light poles
should be located on the exterior of the fence. On and off switches should be manual. Weatherproof outlets
should be provided at each light to provide power at the site. Speaker units connected to the chosen public
address system should also be provided. Water should be at the course site with water faucets installed to
provide water for MWDs and lawn watering. An irrigation system is desirable for long-term lawn
maintenance.
B-15. Obstacles for the course (Figure B-4) include barrels, tunnels, steps, jumps, framed windows, and
dog walks. Each obstacle is 15 to 20 feet from the previous obstacle; the course is run in a sequence.
Obstacles should be constructed to the following specifications:
z Barrel 1 is 35 inches long with a 23-inch opening.
z Barrel 2 is 70 inches long with a 23-inch opening.
z Barrel 3 is 105 inches long with a 23-inch opening.
z The tunnel is 146 inches long with a 19-inch opening.
z The steps are constructed out of wood and are 94 inches high with 5 steps on each side. Each
step is 43 inches wide by 16 inches high by 24 inches long. The top platform is 48 inches long
by 43 inches wide.
z Jumps 1, 2, and 3 are constructed of wood and are 36 inches high at the maximum raised level.
There are 6 removable boards that are 51 inches long by 6 inches high and 1 inch thick.
z The framed window is constructed of wood and is 8 feet tall. The maximum height for the
MWD to negotiate is 36 inches. The window opening is 48 inches wide. Removable boards are
5 1/7 inches wide by 51 inches long and 1 inch thick.
z The A-frame is constructed of wood. Its two sides are 8 feet long by 4 feet wide by 1 inch thick
with 1-inch by 2-inch boards every 6 inches to secure footing. It has a maximum raised height of
6 feet with a base spread of 10 feet.
z The dog walk is constructed of wood and is 26 inches high by 224 inches long and 11 inches
wide with 1-inch by 2-inch boards every 4 inches to secure footing. Each end has a 45° incline
ramp that is 11 inches wide by 49 inches long (included in the 224 overall length measurement).
Note: See DA Pam 190-12 for more complete construction guidelines including the bracing
necessary for the various obstacles.
Military Working Dog Break Area (10 Feet by 20 Feet)
B-16. An MWD break area should be located near the kennels. A break area allows the handler to release
the MWD immediately after exiting the kennels or before entering the kennels so that the MWD can
relieve himself. The area should be enclosed with an 8-foot chain-link fence. Gates should be self-closing
and self-latching and a minimum of 5 feet wide to allow for lawn maintenance equipment. The ground can
be a sandy area for cleaning ease. A water faucet is required to maintain the area.
Exercise Area (20 Feet by 40 Feet)
B-17. The exercise area is a space where the MWD can be released without the handler being present. The
exercise area should not be a shared area with the obedience course, as it would conflict with training
objectives. The exercise area should be visually separated from the obedience course to prevent MWD
from being distracted during training. The exercise area should be grassed, hazard free, and graded slightly
for drainage purposes.

B-19. Since MWDs are likely to visit the administration area (Figure B-5, page B-6) at some point, finishes
should be of durable material, require minimal maintenance, and be easily repaired or replaced in case of
damage. (For example, flooring should be covered by carpet.)
Kennel Master's Office (132 Square Feet)
B-20. The KM's office serves as the nerve center for the complex. Ideally, the office should be located at
the front of the administrative area with exterior windows that view the entry gate to the complex. It
includes a lockable closet for supply storage. Furnishings include a desk, a chair, two visitor chairs, a four-
drawer file cabinet, and a bookcase. Equipment includes a computer, a printer, a fax/copier, and a public
address system or central intercom console.

Appendix B
Figure B-5. Kennel Administrative Areas
Trainer's and Plans Noncommissioned Officer's Office (240 Square Feet)
B-21. The trainer office should provide workspace for two people. Lockable closets are required to store
training aides for each trainer. Furnishings include a desk, a chair, and a four-drawer file cabinet for each
trainer and a common bookcase. Equipment includes a computer, a printer, a copier, and a 4- by 8-foot dry
erase board.
Handlers' Area (210 Square Feet)
B-22. The area for the handlers is an open area for general office functions. It includes—
z Three common workstations, depending on the size of the kennels, for handlers to update
records and complete daily reports.
z Space for document storage.
z Furnishings (three workstations, file cabinets [one four-drawer vertical file per workstation or
the equivalent], and a distribution counter.
z Equipment (computers and a printer).
As a general rule, one workstation should be available for every three handlers assigned to an MWD
section.
B-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Kennel Construction
Controlled-Substance Storage Room
B-23. This room is inside the administrative area and allows sufficient room for the storage safe in which
controlled-substance training aids are stored. The doors are secured using approved locking devices.
Lightweight doors are replaced with solid metal or wood doors or covered with a 9- to 12-gauge security
screen or 16-gauge sheet steel. They are fastened with smooth-headed bolts and nuts and peened in place.
All windows providing access to a storage room that is not staffed 24 hours a day are protected by a 9- to
12-gauge security screen or 3/8-inch or larger diameter steel bars spaced no more than 6 inches apart. The
frames holding the screen or bars must be fastened to the window frame with smooth-headed bolts.
Special-Use Areas
B-24. Special-use areas (Figure B-6, page B-8) are the transition spaces between the administration area
and the kennels. They are important in the day-to-day operations of the MWD facilities. They are not
normally occupied on a daily basis. As such, these areas provide a secondary function of serving as a noise
buffer between the kennels and the administrative areas. The special-use areas provide a workspace for the
VCO and accommodate the unique storage requirements for the kennels.
Veterinary Treatment Room
B-25. A veterinary treatment room is used to perform health care and first aid for MWDs since many
locations do not have veterinary treatment areas in close proximity to the kennels. In order to maintain
sanitary conditions, treatment rooms require a higher degree of cleanliness and durability than the rest of
the support building. Basic finish requirements are—
z Seamless floors with an integral base.
z Washable walls.
z Painted gypsum board ceilings.
z Cabinets faced with plastic laminate.
z Solid-surface countertops.
B-26. Interior partitions should provide a sound transmission class rating of 50 to 55. Floor drains are
centered in the room to aid in cleaning, and a dedicated floor drain is located under the isolation kennel.
Wall and base cabinets with drawers are installed, including stainless steel dual washbasins with hot and
cold water. One section of wall cabinets should be lockable so that prescription medicines for MWDs may
be stored in the room. In addition to the normal electrical outlets required by code, a 220-volt outlet is
required to support other portable equipment that may be used. Equipment for the room includes the
following:
z An MWD isolation kennel. The entire structure should be made of uniform, nonglare type 304
stainless steel. The frame, cross members, and vertical spokes should be welded together at
every intersection. Latches and hinges are made of 12-gauge stainless steel. The floor of the pen
is a raised, removable grate. The floor grate is a heavy-gauge stainless steel, plastic-coated
section installed 1 3/4 inches off the floor. A dedicated floor drain is required for this kennel.
z Standard table tub. The tub is made of type 304 stainless steel with a minimum depth of 15
inches. The tub slopes to the drain end. The design includes a removable, bathing rack made of
plastic-coated stainless steel that fits into the bottom of the tub to give MWDs better footing
during treatments. Faucets include a flexible, stainless steel hose that will extend the length of
the tub and spray powerfully to reach all areas of the tub.
z Exam room light. A ceiling-mounted exam room light with an arm extension and swivel
capacity of 360° is recommended.
z Walk-on platform scale. The scale is a type 304 stainless steel platform with a wall- or
post-mounted light-emitting diode (LED) display. The scale is able to perform calibration and
weigh animals to the nearest 0.1 of a pound or kilogram.
z Stationary exam table. The table top is type 304 stainless steel die-formed from one piece of
20-gauge steel. It should have raised edges to prevent fluid runoff and be permanently attached
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 B-7

Appendix B
to a heavy base. There should be a minimum 35-inch work height from the floor to the top of the
table. The heavy base should have adjustable leveling screws.
Figure B-6. Kennel Special-Use Areas
Tack Room (108 Square Feet)
B-27. The tack room is for the storage of extra MWD equipment, such as bite suits and portable kennels.
The tack room is located near the entrance to the kennels but not the main building entrance. Requirements
include 12 linear feet of shelves that are 18-inches wide and 36 inches deep and allow for 36 inches above
each shelf; a 24-inch space with hooks to hang items on; and 6 linear feet of shelves that are 18 inches
wide and 12 inches deep and allow for 18 inches above each shelf.
Food Storage Room (96 Square Feet)
B-28. The food storage room is normally for the bulk storage of a 30-day supply of food for the MWDs.
The room is adjacent to the kennels with an exterior entry. The entry is a pair of 36-inch doors to allow for
palletized food delivery and storage. Doors require weather stripping and thresholds to aid in insect and
rodent control. Temperature and humidity control equivalent to the office area is required to control food
spoilage. A minimum separation of 2 inches is required between the walls and the stored food to allow for
air circulation. Shelving should be installed to meet local delivery operations.
B-8 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Kennel Construction
SUPPORT AREAS
B-29. The support areas (Figure B-7) provide space for the common-use areas of the building. Areas for
the multipurpose room, latrines, communications, and mechanical necessities form the core of the support
areas. Support areas should be centrally located and easily accessible for building occupants or
maintenance personnel in the case of the mechanical room.
Figure B-7. Kennel Support Areas
Latrine, Shower, and Lockers (206 Square Feet)
B-30. A unisex area is divided into three rooms for the latrine, shower, and lockers. One room is a
handicapped accessible latrine with a water closet and lavatory for general use. The locker room includes
10 full-height metal lockers and a bench for MWD handlers' use. The shower room includes a shower,
bench, water closet, and lavatory. Do not neglect to include other accessories such as mirrors, soap
dispensers, paper towel dispensers, disposal units, grab bars, and hooks.
Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, Mechanical, Electrical, and Communications Systems
B-31. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is a process to add hot or cold air in a facility. It
also introduces fresh air in to the facility to maintain indoor air quality and eliminate sick building
syndrome. Design HVAC systems to optimize energy use and meet the design criteria for the area in which
you are located. Place the hot water heater in the mechanical room and with a capacity that will meet the
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 B-9

Appendix B
demands of the latrine and shower; multipurpose room; and veterinary treatment room. Locate electrical
panels in this area as well. Although a recommended size is shown on the plans, the room should be big
enough to support the equipment required for the location.
B-32. While the number of instruments and computers is not large, the communications closet is vital to
the success of the organization. Provide a minimum of one prewired telephone and LAN outlet for each
workstation, one in each common area, and one in the kennel food preparation area. Include telephone and
LAN outlets for fax machines and printers. Conceal conduit in the walls.
Multipurpose Room (196 Square Feet)
B-33. The multipurpose room serves as a combination conference room, classroom, and break room. Food
preparation requirements are a light, a countertop, and base and upper wall cabinets for storage. Lighting
should have a variable-level control for use as a conference room and/or classroom. Furnishings include
either a conference table for fifteen or three five-person tables; chairs; a bulletin board; and a 4- by 8-foot
dry erase board. Equipment includes a video projection system, a projector screen, a sink, a microwave
oven, and a refrigerator.
KENNEL AREA
B-34. The kennel area provides the daily living environment for the MWDs, giving each MWD a private
place for eating and resting. Kennel areas should be built to accommodate large-breed dogs and designed
as modular structures to allow for the future expansion of runs.
B-35. There are three types of kennel areas; indoor kennels, outdoor kennels, and indoor/outdoor kennels.
The preferred standard is the combination indoor/outdoor kennel; however, there are factors that must be
taken into consideration when selecting the kennel type. Cost is always a consideration, but climate also
influences the selection. In cold weather climates, the benefit-to-cost ratio will drive the selection to an
indoor kennel while the opposite is true for hot weather climates. The more temperate the climate the more
suited the indoor/outdoor kennel is for use. Each type of kennel includes the same space requirements. A
kennel includes kennel runs with doghouses, a food preparation area, a storage area, and a mechanical
room.
B-36. The kennel should be separated from the administrative building by a minimum of 20 feet. This
provides separation between different functions and aids in noise control. As a result of the constant
interaction between the two facilities, a covered walkway is required to connect the facilities and provide
protection from the elements. Care should be taken in the layout of the kennel in relation to the
administrative building; a one-way system should be maintained in the movement of MWDs. The objective
is to avoid situations where MWDs meet face to face and to prevent confrontations. Consider installing
mirrors at corners, intersections, and blind spots to alert handlers of potential wrong-way traffic.
B-37. All entries and exits from the kennel area are required to be self-closing and self-latching. Doors
exiting the kennel runs should open inward to aid in preventing MWD escape. Proper ventilation is
important in the kennels to prevent the spread of diseases and to control odors. It is recommended that the
ventilation standard be to cycle out the room air 10 to 15 times per hour. Kennel temperature should range
from 45° to 85° Fahrenheit with humidity in the range of 40 percent to 70 percent. Temperature should be
maintained within 10° of the exterior temperature. MWDs work more effectively and are more alert when
the kennel temperature is close to the temperature of their working environment.
B-38. Potable water is required at the kennels. Hot and cold water lines are installed at ceiling level down
the length of the 5-foot wide center corridor connecting to hose reels at each end of the corridor. A high-
pressure washer is required to assist in sanitizing and cleaning kennel runs.
B-39. Since the kennel is basically a wet environment, all electrical receptacles should be provided with
ground fault circuit interrupters and all-weather covers. Receptacles mounted at 48 inches above the
finished floor are required at each end of the central corridor.
B-40. Each kennel run should have a waterproof light fixture that has an individual switch at the corridor
entrance. Other areas require general-purpose lighting according to industry standards. All drain lines in
B-10 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Kennel Construction
the kennel should be a minimum of 6 inches in diameter and be designed to sustain flow velocities that will
maintain a self-cleansing action. Due to the nature of the waste, cleanouts should be numerous and easily
accessible. Floor drains should be included in the central corridor to aid in the cleaning of kennels.
Indoor/Outdoor Kennel
B-41. A combination indoor/outdoor kennel (Figure B-8, page B-12) simply implies that there is an
interior run and an exterior run linked with each MWD living area. A guillotine type door will connect the
interior run and the exterior run. Other door types may be used, but the idea is to permit isolation of the
MWD during cleaning operations. Ideally, operation of the door is from the central corridor and from the
outside of the exterior run. At 6 feet above the finished floor, use translucent wall panels in the wall
separating the runs to provide natural light inside the kennel.
B-42. The roof should extend over the exterior runs and include gutters and/or downspouts to prevent
excessive water in the runs. Exterior framing should be enclosed with a soffit to prevent birds from
roosting. Exterior water faucets (with freeze protection where required) with both hot and cold water are
required at each corner of the building. These are necessary for cleaning exterior runs. Floor drains
(Figure B-9, page B-12) should be located in the corner of each run adjacent to the common wall
separating exterior and interior runs. Drains should tie-in to a common waste line. Drain covers should be
flush with the floor. Kennel floors should slope (at least 1/4- inch per foot) toward the drains to allow for
quick water drainage and drying.
Indoor or Outdoor Kennel
B-43. The plan for the indoor or outdoor kennel (Figure B-10, page B-13) is the same for either style. The
obvious difference is the wall that encloses the kennels. For indoor kennels, the exterior walls along the
runs should have windows beginning at 6 feet above the finished floor to allow for natural light. Windows
should be operable and hinged at the sill to tilt inward to prevent the escape of MWDs. For outdoor
kennels, the exterior wall is simply an 8-foot chain-link fence. Water faucets with hot and cold water are
required at each corner of the building. These are required to clean the gutter and drain system
(Figure B-11, page B-13) for the kennel. A gutter and drainage system is provided at the back of the kennel
run for either type of kennel for sluicing wastewaters from cleaning operations. Kennel run floors should
slope to the gutter and the gutter should slope to the drain. Gutters should be sufficient to allow for easy
cleaning. A minimum of 3 feet should be allowed between the end of the kennel and the wall or fence.
Kennel Run
B-44. Runs should be arranged so that openings are staggered in order to avoid MWDs facing each other
across the corridor. Full-height partitions are required between runs for all kennel types. The first 6 feet of
wall above the floor should be sealed concrete. For interior runs, steel clad acoustical panels should be
considered from the top of the concrete partition to the ceiling. Steel clad acoustical ceiling panels should
also be considered above the kennels.
B-45. Heavy-gauge chain-link fence is used for exterior runs and is also an option for interior runs.
Because of the noise generated in the enclosed area of an interior run, it is important that noise-reducing
materials be introduced to prevent stress to the MWD and hearing loss to personnel.
B-46. As a minimum, end walls should be full-height, galvanized chain-link fencing. Take care to prevent
sharp edges from bolts, hinges, and tie wires on the interior of the runs where MWDs may be cut or
harmed. Self-latching entry gates should swing 180° and be able to cover the opening of the MWD house.
This allows the MWD to be penned in the house during run-cleaning operations. A stainless steel water
bucket is required for each kennel, including a holder that prevents the MWD from overturning the bucket.

Kennel Construction
Figure B-10. Indoor or Outdoor Kennel
Figure B-11. Example of an Indoor or Outdoor Kennel Floor Drain
B-47. Flooring should be concrete and slope toward floor drains and/or gutters to provide rapid runoff of
water and drying. Since runs are subject to frequent wash downs to clean and prevent disease, a smooth
epoxy-type finish is needed. Temperature-controlled floors should be emplaced for locations that have
inclement weather.
B-48. All materials in areas accessible to MWDs should be resistant to damage by scratching, biting, and
chewing. Materials should be durable and easy to sanitize. Avoid using material such as angle iron that
rusts over a period of time and generates sharp edges that pose a danger to MWDs.
B-49. MWD houses are 4 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet sealed, concrete boxes with a metal top. Tops should
hinge toward the end wall in order to be raised to clean the house or treat an MWD. Once lifted, a holding
device should be available to keep the top open. Wall opening dimensions are shown in Figure B-12, page
B-14. The house should be a minimum of 8 inches and a maximum of 12 inches above the run floor. The
house floor should have positive drainage toward the wall opening.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 B-13

Appendix B
Figure B-12. MWD House
Storage and Mechanical Area
B-50. Additional storage for the kennel is provided. A commercial quality ice machine is required to aid in
cooling down MWDs. Include a floor drain for the area. If a veterinary treatment room is not included, a
digital scale should be located in this area. Design mechanical systems to optimize energy use and meet the
design criteria for the area where the kennel is located. Include the hot water heater in the mechanical room
and with a capacity to meet the demands of the kennel. Allow for the location of electrical panels in this
area as well.
Food Preparation Room (112 Square Feet)
B-51. The food preparation area is where feedings are prepared and feeding pans/bowls are stored and
cleaned. Food preparation for MWDs requires a large countertop with a deep, three-compartment stainless
steel sink. Upper wall cabinets are required for general storage. An under the counter refrigerator, a
dishwasher, and space to store food for daily use are necessary for operation. A 2-foot space at the end of
the counter should accommodate a storing and drying rack for pans and bowls. Lighting and receptacles
and a floor drain should be installed per the code. A telephone, bulletin board, feeding chart, and large
garbage can should also be provided. Optional equipment includes a garbage disposal unit and a stackable
washer and dryer.

Appendix D
Training Records
This appendix provides samples and details of how to properly use MWD training
records. Records must be maintained for the life of the MWD. At least one year of
historical documents must be maintained on file at each kennel for every MWD.
Records can be discarded two years after the death, adoption, or euthanasia of the
MWD. Nearly all MWDs have a dual purpose (PD and PEDD or PNDD); therefore,
every MWD should have a PD and a PEDD/PNDD form on file. Kennels that have
internet access can obtain records via the Military Working Dog Management System
(MWDMS).
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY FORM 2807-R
D-1. DA Form 2807-R (Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record) (Figure D-1, page D-3)
is a standard form used by all MWD personnel. It is used to record the training and utilization of PDs. Use
the following instructions when preparing a DA Form 2807-R:
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA
D-2. Enter the following information in the appropriate blocks:
z The date.
z The MWD's name and type, tattoo number, and age.
z The handler's name and grade.
z The organization and the location.
TRAINING
D-3. The training section of the form provides complete information on all of the training tasks that must
be accomplished for a PD to maintain proficiency. It is not necessary to train on all of the
controlled-aggression tasks during the same day; however, all of the controlled-aggression tasks must be
trained every week.
D-4. Entries for the amount of time spent training on specific tasks during a particular day of the month
are made in minutes. The monthly total for each specific task will be in hours and will be automatically
entered in the far right-hand column titled "Total Hours." The handler's or trainer's evaluation of the
MWD's daily rating is entered as S or U. Remarks are mandatory for any area the MWD fails to perform to
standard. These remarks will be annotated on the reverse side of the form using the following format:
z Deficiency (DF). The MWD's shortcoming.
z Corrective action (CA). The handler's response to the MWD's deficiency.
z Corrective response (CR). The MWD's response to the CA.
D-5. Enter the appropriate information on—
z Line 1. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on obedience on leash.
z Line 2. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on obedience off leash.
z Line 3. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on the obedience course.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 D-1

Appendix D
z Line 4. Record the daily rating of the MWD on controlled aggression (either S or U). Write an
explanation of any U rating on the reverse side of the form. In 4a to 4e, record the number of
minutes per day that the MWD trained on each controlled-aggression task.
z Line 5. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD trained on building searches on
line 5.
z Line 6. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD trained on gunfire with the
handler firing the weapon. The number of rounds will be annotated on the reverse side of the form.
z Line 7. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on gunfire with a third
party firing a weapon. The number of rounds will be annotated on the reverse side of the form.
z Line 8. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on scouting/patrolling.
Record the distance (in feet) for scent, sight, and sound detection on lines 8a, b, or c.
z Line 9. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on vehicle patrol.
z Line 10. Record the number of minutes per day that the MWD is trained on tracking.
z Line 11. Record the daily training rating (S or U). Explain deficiencies on the reveres side of the
form. Any failure of a critical task requires a U daily training rating. See DA Pam 190-12 for
critical tasks.
UTILIZATION
D-6. The utilization section of the form provides a daily record of the time spent performing military
police duties in the three general categories of combat support operations, patrol–law enforcement, and
patrol–security.
D-7. The combat support operations category may be used to record time spent performing military police
missions (actual or training) in support of combat units. Such operations include field training exercises,
CP exercises, mobilization exercises, and other activities related to the tactical and strategic missions of the
Army, provided that these missions are accomplished with a handler and an MWD together as a certified team.
D-8. The patrol–law enforcement category may be used to record time spent performing law enforcement
or force protection type missions. These missions include but are not limited to—
z Random vehicle searches.
z Law enforcement patrols.
z Other duties performed while working in a law enforcement type mission.
D-9. The patrol–security category may be used to record time spent performing security type missions
such as—
z Dignitary security.
z Critical asset patrolling in a peacetime environment.
z USSS, Department of State, or other explosive type searches.
D-10. The daily rating of the MWD's performance on military police duties is recorded as S or U. All U
performance annotations will have an explanation for the DF and have the CA taken recorded on the
reverse side of the form and continuation sheets, if necessary. The total monthly utilization hours are
recorded in the last column, titled "Total Hours."
D-11. When training is conducted during the actual use and employment of an MWD, the time used for
training may also be reported in the training section. This training is not an automatic entry every time the
team has utilization hours. Time annotated as training during utilization hours will be actual time training
on patrol or detector tasks. It is unethical to count all or even half of an MWD team's utilization hours as
both utilization and training time for every shift, and unrealistic numbers will not be accepted. When time
is recorded as utilization and training, a notation is made on the reverse side of the form explaining the
double time entry and the type of training conducted. This will make it possible to differentiate between
training time, training time while on duty, and duty (utilization) time. Although additional training during
utilization hours is acceptable, it will not be accepted as the primary amount of mandatory training hours
each week.

DAILY FEEDING
D-14. Record the quantity of food that the MWD eats every day in this section. If the MWD is fed once
daily, the type and amount of food will be noted in the first block to the left. Under quantity of food, the
amount eaten for each feeding will be annotated as follows:
z "A" if all food was eaten.
z "3/4" if three-quarters was eaten.
z "1/2" if half was eaten.
z "1/4" if one-quarter was eaten.
z "0" if none of the food was eaten.
D-15. If the MWD is fed twice daily, the second block is used to record the second daily feeding (which
could be a different type of food). If the MWD is fed once daily, the second block may be used to record a
change in the diet of the MWD, directed by the veterinarian. Block 2 may also be used to indicate the type
and amount of food used daily for MWDs on a food reward system. Monitoring MWD food consumption
is a critical portion of the required daily health checks.
D-16. The last column, titled "Wt of Dog," is used to record a semimonthly weight for the MWD. The
weight checks occur on or around the first and the fifteenth day of each month. There is sufficient room
under the headings "Date" and "Lbs" to record both the date when the MWD is weighed and the weight in
pounds. Any drastic changes in food consumption or weight gain or loss are reported to the veterinarian.
D-17. Enter the following information in the appropriate blocks:
z Enter the VCO's prescribed amount of food to be given daily directly under "Daily Feeding."
Both blocks are used when an MWD is fed twice daily.
z Record the amount of food eaten per day, in the appropriate day's block under "Quantity of Food
(by Weight)."
z Record the date and weight of the MWD in the respective blocks in the bottom right-hand
corner.
REMARKS
D-18. The reverse side of DA Form 2807-R (Figure D-1) is used to annotate advanced techniques used
during training and DFs with CAs and CRs listed. This section is very important for probable cause and
shows the time line of events for training. Each day is listed with the action taken on that day. If no training
is conducted due to company type training, the words "soldier development" are written on the line
followed by the type of training conducted. "Soldier development" is only used when MWD handlers are
conducting training in which the MWD is not needed or not taken. If no training is conducted due to leave,
passes, or scheduled days off, no entry is needed; DA Form 6 (Duty Roster) can be used to verify these
days.
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY FORM 3992-R (FIRST PAGE)
D-19. DA Form 3992-R (Narcotics or Explosives Detector Dog Training and Utilization Record)
(Figure D-2, page D-9) is a standard form used by all MWD personnel. It is used to record the use and
training of detector dogs. Use the following instructions when preparing a DA Form 3992-R:
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA
D-20. Enter the following information in the appropriate blocks:
z The date.
z The MWD's name and type, tattoo number, and age.
z The handler's name and grade.
z The organization and location.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 D-5

Appendix D
TRAINING
D-21. The training section of the form is used for recording all training of the detector dog team in the
particular detection skill. The detection areas of buildings, containers, and vehicles are listed. There is one
blank space for detector training in other areas. Examples of other areas may include—
z Mail facilities.
z Open or wooded areas.
z Warehouses.
z Aircraft.
z Areas considered significant or unique to the command to which the MWD team is assigned.
D-22. Although some of the examples may be included under one of the three prelisted categories, the
others should be listed separately. For areas covered under the three general headings, the handler or
trainer annotates the specific location under the appropriate day in the remarks (for example, Smith High
School, NCO Club, or Corps Auditorium).
D-23. The top line of each training category is divided diagonally into two blocks. The top of each block is
used to record the number of training aids planted for that day's detector training. The bottom of each block
is used for the number of training aids found by the proper response of the detector dog. If the MWD
responds on the same training aid more than once in the same training scenario, it will not be counted as a
find unless the number of plants is changed as well. At no time will there be more finds annotated than
there are plants. Continually allowing the MWD to return to the last aid found creates false response
problems in the MWD and should not be encouraged. It is the handler's responsibility to keep the MWD
from returning to the scent cone of the last found training aid, whether the MWD is being worked on or off
leash. Once the MWD has entered the scent cone, he must be allowed to work to the source and final
respond. At no time will an MWD be yanked off an aid once he is working the scent cone.
D-24. The bottom line of each training category is used to record the search time. Search time is the
amount of time devoted to detector training that day. Detector training is the time from the moment the
handler enters a problem and commands the MWD to "Seek" until the MWD has completed the search of
that training problem, excluding handler or MWD breaks. Add the daily time entries in each training
category, and enter the results in the last column, titled "Total Hours."
D-25. Record the following information beside the appropriate training location (building, containers,
vehicles, or other):
z Plants/Finds. Record the number of plants in the top half of the block and the number of finds
in the lower half.
z Search Time. Record the amount of time devoted for detector training that day.
z Training Total Hours. Record the sum of hours performing detection missions in the far right
UTILIZATION
D-26. All operational detection missions are recorded in the utilization section. The detection missions are
listed. Detection missions that are significantly different from these are listed separately to give an accurate
record of the types of missions for which the detector dog team is used. There are two blocks under each
day of the month for each utilization category. The top block is for recording the number of times the
MWD detected a substance. The bottom block is for recording the total search or inspection time for the
detection mission. The last column is the sum of the daily times. It gives a record of the total amount of
time spent performing the detection missions for that month. The number of finds for the month can also be
totaled and entered in the last column, above the time entry.
D-27. Record the following information beside the appropriate location (building, containers, vehicles, or
other):
z Finds. Record the number of times the MWD finds the substance on a detection mission.
z Search Time. Record the total search time.
D-6 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Training Records
DETECTOR DOG SEARCH DATA
D-28. All relevant information about the productivity and success of each detection mission is recorded
using the "Detector Dog Search Data" section. The location may be a building number, a unit designation,
map grid coordinates, and/or any other information that helps identify where the detection mission was
performed.
D-29. The MPR number is the number assigned to the case by military police to account for the custody
and disposition of the substances found. The substance is the identification of the found material by a
common name, such as heroin, marijuana, dynamite, or detonating cord.
D-30. Quantity is the measure of the amount of the substance found. Weight, volume, overall dimensions,
length, or any other appropriate measure may be used.
D-31. The "Remarks" section may be used for adding any other relevant information about the substance
found. This would include a field or laboratory verification of the type of substance, an EOD evaluation of
an explosive device or explosive substance as live or inert, or the presence of other hazardous material in
or around the substance found (such as razor blades, trip wires, or poisons). Record any information that
may be useful in preparing the team for future searches or that may be applicable or useful to other detector
dog teams.
D-32. Record the following information in the appropriate boxes:
z Time. Record the time the detector dog performed the mission.
z Date. Record the date the detector dog performed the mission.
z Location. Record the exact location of the detector mission (such as front gate, Fort Sill,
Oklahoma; National Airport, Gabon, Africa; or building 442, Fort Bragg, North Carolina).
z Military Police Report (MPR) Number. Record the MPR number in this column, if
applicable.
z Substance. Record the common name of the substance found, if applicable.
z Quantity. Record the quantity of the substance found, if applicable.
z Remarks. Use this column to record any other relevant information about the substance found
(such as a positive response, no response, or a lab verification).
DETECTOR DOG PROFICIENCY (SECOND PAGE)
D-33. A correct response occurs when the MWD detects the substance and responds with the proper final
response, and the training aid or substance is found in the general location where the MWD has responded.
A not-at-source response is a training tool used to help an MWD team move closer to the source location
of a training aid plant. The distance away from the source in order for a not-at-source response to be given
is six to ten feet.
D-34. A missed response is when the MWD fails to detect and respond to the presence of a training aid
with a final response. A handler miss or error is when—
z The handler fails to search or clear an area with the MWD and a training aid plant is missed.
z The handler fails to read an MWD's change of behavior and pulls the MWD away from the area
where a training aid is planted and a training aid plant is missed.
z The handler presents an area but fails to ensure that the MWD is sniffing and a training aid plant
is missed.
Handler misses or errors are considered missed explosives or narcotics and are counted against the find rate
percentages of the MWD team.
D-35. False responses are noted in the second to last section of DA Form 3992-R. A false response is when
the MWD responds as if he has detected a substance and the handler accepts that response, but no training
aid or substance can be found within a reasonable distance of the MWD's final response.
D-36. The detector dog team's proficiency is computed monthly by adding the total number of correct
responses ("a" for the month) and adding the total number of false/missed (MWD or handler) responses
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 D-7

Appendix D
("b" for the month). These two numbers are used in the following formula to obtain the detector dog team's
proficiency rating:
⎛ a ⎞
⎜ ⎟100= proficienc y
⎝ a +b ⎠
D-37. For example, during the month the detector dog team made 93 correct responses on training aids, the
MWD team also had 4 false responses, 2 MWD and 1 handler missed responses for a total of 7
false/missed responses. Applying these two numbers (a=93 and b=7) to the formula, the following is
obtained:
⎛ 93 ⎞
⎜ ⎟100 = 93 %
⎝ 93 +7 ⎠
D-38. The computation above shows that the MWD team is working at a 93 percent proficiency rate. This
rate is above the minimum for a PNDD team (90 percent), but it is below the minimum standard for a
PEDD team (95 percent). A PNDD handler should continue training to maintain and possibly increase the
team's proficiency. A PEDD handler needs to identify the causes of the team's substandard performance
and immediately begin corrective training to bring the team up to and over the minimum 95 percent
detection proficiency standard.
Note: Responses on actual substances during actual searches are not included in this
computation. Search data cannot be included because it is impossible to determine the number
of false or missed responses during an actual search.
D-39. Record the following information on—
z Line a. Record the total correct alerts. The MWDMS makes these entries automatically.
z Line b. Record the total false or missed alerts. The MWDMS makes these entries automatically.
NARCOTICS OR EXPLOSIVE DETECTOR DOG TRAINING AND UTILIZATION RECORD (THIRD
AND FOURTH PAGES)
D-40. The first part of section of the Narcotics or Explosive Detector Dog Training and Utilization Record
section is used to record the number of each training aid used in training on each day of the month. The
entry for each training aid type is divided into three rows to record the day of the month, correct alerts, and
missed alerts, respectively. Record the appropriate information in the following sections.
Administrative Data. Record the MWD's name and tattoo number, the month, and the year

in the appropriate blocks.
Aid Type. Enter the specific aid type in the upper left-hand corner of each "Detector Dog

Proficiency" section.
Total Correct Alerts. Record the number of correct alerts the MWD made during training.

Missed Alerts. Record the number of missed and false alerts the MWD made during

training.
Proficiency. Record the actual proficiency in this block. The MWDMS makes this entry

automatically.
REMARKS
D-41. Remarks for DA Form 3992-R are recorded on a continuation sheet. Each DF (for example, a
missed aid or false sit) is listed by the date it occurred. The CA and CR are also listed. If more than one DF
is noted per day, number the DF, CA, and CR series to avoid confusion.

Appendix F
Force Protection Conditions
The FPCONs outlined below describe the progressive level of a terrorist threat to all
US military facilities and personnel under DOD Directive 2000.12. As approved by
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the terminology and definitions in this appendix are
recommended security measures designed to ease interservice coordination and to
support US military antiterrorism activities. Each installation must localize these
measures for its specific circumstances, accounting for service and commander
requirements, local laws, and SOFAs as a minimum. See AR 525-13 for further
details concerning FPCONs. This appendix details what each condition is and the
suggested actions of the MWD teams for each level and measure. Commanders are
encouraged to employ MWD teams wherever an MWD team can enhance security
and force protection measures that are already established.
FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION NORMAL
F-1. FPCON normal applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists. It warrants a
routine security posture.
FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION ALPHA
F-2. FPCON Alpha applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against
personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable. Alpha measures must be capable
of being maintained indefinitely. The following bullets explain the FPCON Alpha measures:
z Alpha measure 1. Inform personnel and family members of the general situation at regular
intervals. Also, remind them to be alert for and report suspicious activities such as the presence
of unfamiliar personnel and vehicles, suspicious/unattended parcels, and possible surveillance
attempts.
z Alpha measure 2. Ensure that the duty officer or personnel with access to building plans as
well as the plans for area evacuations are available at all times. Plans to execute access control
procedures should be in place. Key personnel required to implement security plans should be on
call and readily available.
z Alpha measure 3. Secure and randomly inspect buildings, rooms, and storage areas not in
regular use.
Note: MWD should randomly inspect buildings after normal duty hours. The KM should ensure
that no inspection time or location patterns are ever set by MWD teams.
z Alpha measure 4. Increase security spot checks of vehicles and persons entering installations
under the jurisdiction of the United States.
Note: MWD should perform vehicle checks randomly at entry points.
z Alpha measure 5. Limit access points for vehicles and personnel commensurate with a
reasonable flow of traffic.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 F-1

Appendix F
z Alpha measure 6. Apply Alpha measures 4, 5, 7, or 8 either individually or in combination with
each other as a deterrent.
z Alpha measure 7. Review intelligence, counterintelligence, and operations dissemination
procedures.
z Alpha measure 8. Review and, if necessary, implement security measures for HRP.
z Alpha measure 9. Consult local authorities on the threat and mutual antiterrorism measures as
appropriate.
z Alpha measure 10. Review all plans and be prepared to implement a higher FPCON.
z Alpha measure 11 (spare). Add additional measures as deemed appropriate by the commanders.
FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION BRAVO
F-3. FPCON Bravo applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists.
Sustaining Bravo measures for a prolonged period may affect operational capabilities and impact relations
with local authorities. The following bullets explain the FPCON Bravo measures:
z Bravo measure 1. Continue, or introduce, all measures in the previous FPCON level.
z Bravo measure 2. Check plans for the implementation of the next FPCON level.
z Bravo measure 3. Identify critical and high-occupancy buildings. Move cars and objects (such
as crates and trash containers) away from buildings to reduce vulnerability to bomb attacks.
Consider centralized parking.
z Bravo measure 4. Secure and inspect all buildings, rooms, and storage areas not in regular use.
z Bravo measure 5. Inspect the interior and exterior of buildings in regular use for suspicious
packages at the beginning and end of each workday, as well as at random intervals. Patrol teams
search the exterior of high-occupancy buildings at the beginning and end of each day.
Note: Use PEDD to search buildings and areas.
z Bravo measure 6. Implement mail-screening procedures to identify suspicious letters and
parcels.
Note: Search the mail distribution center with both PEDD and PNDD teams randomly.
z Bravo measure 7. Inspect commercial deliveries randomly. Advise family members to check
home deliveries.
z Bravo measure 8. Increase presence around and surveillance of domestic accommodations,
schools, messes, clubs, and other soft targets to improve deterrence and defense and build
confidence among staff and dependents.
Note: Randomly patrol and perform walking patrols of populated areas with MWDs.
z Bravo measure 9. Implement plans to enhance off-installation security of DOD facilities. In
areas with threat levels of moderate, significant, or high, coverage includes facilities (such as
DOD schools and daycare centers) and transportation services and routes (such as bus routes)
used by DOD employees and family members.
z Bravo measure 10. Inform local security committees of actions being taken.
z Bravo measure 11. Verify the identity of visitors and randomly inspect their suitcases, parcels,
and other containers.
z Bravo measure 12. Conduct random patrols to check vehicles, people, and buildings.
z Bravo measure 13. Implement additional security measures for HRP.
z Bravo measure 14. Identify and brief personnel who may augment guard forces. Review
specific rules of engagement including the use of deadly force.
F-2 FM 3-19.17 6 July 2005

Force Protection Conditions
z Bravo measure 15. Test the mass notification system.
z Bravo measure 16. Verify the identity of all personnel entering buildings as deemed
appropriate.
z Bravo measure 17. Identify off-installation safe havens for use at the next FPCON.
z Bravo measure 18. Review and implement proper OPSEC, communications security
(COMSEC), and information security (INFOSEC) status.
z Bravo measure 19. Consider using tactical deception techniques.
z Bravo measure 20 (spare). Add additional measures as deemed appropriate by the

Appendix G
After-Action Reviews
The AAR process is used to document and discuss MWD operations and training.
AARs are focused on performance standards that enable other MWD handlers,
training NCOs, KMs, program managers, and concerned agencies to discover what
happened, why it happened, and how to sustain strengths and improve on
weaknesses. Leaders, planners, and developers can use AARs to get the maximum
benefit from every mission or task conducted during predeployment, deployment,
and redeployment.
AFTER-ACTION REVIEW PURPOSE
G-1. AARs must provide—
z Candid insights into specific soldier, leader, and MWD strengths and weaknesses from various
perspectives.
z Feedback and insight critical to future successes.
z Details that evaluation reports alone often lack.
G-2. The USAMPS MWD Career Management NCO collects historical data, end-of-tour reports, and
other organizational specific issues. With the submission of AARs, USAMPS can build a historical
database to benefit all in the improvement of Army MWD team tactics, techniques, and procedures.
Ultimately, information will be submitted to the Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) for distribution
to the Army.
AFTER-ACTION REVIEW SUBMISSION
G-3. After the completion of TDY missions, special operations, deployments or other significant events,
MWD handlers submit AARs to their respective MACOMs. MACOMs forward the AARs to HQDA
Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG) and USAMPS.
POINT OF CONTACT
G-4. The point of contact for the MWD Career Management NCO is commercial: (573) 563-8040 and
defense switched network (DSN): 676-8040/7946. Send hard-copy correspondence to: US Army Military
Police School, ATTN: ATSJ-P, 401 MANSCEN Loop, Suite 1058, Fort Leonard Wood, MO 65473-8926.

Appendix H
Health and Welfare Inspections Briefing Guide
Commanders frequently request MWD support during health and welfare
inspections. Commanders should be made aware that the conduct and responsibility
of health and welfare inspections lies within their purview and that the MWD team is
not the authority for the mission. This appendix identifies the actions that need to be
addressed with the commander to ensure a successful and lawful health and welfare
inspection. These actions are needed to establish and act on probable cause
determinations. Questions concerning these matters should be directed to the local
Staff Judge Advocate Office for clarification.
COORDINATION
H-1. The KM coordinates and approves each health and welfare inspection. After the KM receives the
request for assistance, he assesses the needs of the mission and determines which detector dog team (if
any) will assist the commander. The KM notifies the unit commander or 1SG and accepts or denies the
mission. Once the mission is accepted, the KM briefs them on their roles and responsibilities and informs
them that if his criteria are not met, the KM will terminate the search.
HANDLERS BRIEFING
H-2. Prior to the inspection, the KM, plans NCO, or handler ensures that the commander requesting
support is aware that the building being inspected must be unoccupied and that all doors are unlocked (or
keys available on site). On the arrival of the MWD team at the location of the health and welfare
inspection, the handler performs a commander's briefing and demonstration. The handler—
z Explains the probable cause folder to the commander.
z Shows the commander the training aids used for detection.
z Demonstrates the dog's ability to detect.
H-3. A briefing document shows handlers how to record the details of each health and welfare inspection
(Figure H-1, page H-3). The commander is provided with a copy of the briefing document containing the
following information:
z The MWD teams used for the inspection.
z The canines' names and tattoo numbers.
z The scope of the proficiency training of the MWD teams. Discuss with the commander the
standards and scope of the detector training required to maintain the certification of assigned
MWD teams.
z The MWDs' accuracy rates. Explain to the commander that the accuracy percentage rate is based
on quarterly training.
z The MWDs' detection experience. Inform the commander of the amount of time that the MWDs
have actually spent conducting detection missions. Include any possible finds in prior
inspections.
z The MWDs' capabilities. Explain to the commander that the MWDs are capable of detecting
either drugs or explosives.
6 July 2005 FM 3-19.17 H-1

Appendix H
z The MWDs' alert response. Describe what the MWDs will do when they indicate the presence
or odor of found drugs or explosives.
z The unit representatives. Notify the commander that one SSG or above is required to escort each
MWD team through out the inspection. The commander may not be a unit representative.
UNIT REPRESENTATIVE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
H-4. Ensure that the unit representatives are informed that they—
z Escort the MWD team at all times.
z Unlock doors or areas as needed.
z Carefully observe the MWD team.
z Follow the handler's instructions.
z Obey safety precautions.
z Spot areas that are missed by the MWD team.
DOCUMENTATION
H-5. It is important that the MWD handler documents the commander's briefing on every occasion.
Figure H-1, page H-3, gives an example for documenting the briefing given to the commander before a
health and welfare inspection. Advise the commander to maintain the handlers briefing and other
documentation concerning each response of the MWD. Advise the commander that a positive response by
a narcotic detector dog provides probable cause for a command-directed urinalysis. Ensure that the
commander signs the briefing form and then provide a copy for filing in case of a judicial action.
INSPECTION
H-6. After the briefing has been conducted, the inspection may begin. Remember to advise the
commander and unit representatives that this health and welfare inspection is the unit's mission and that the
MWD team is assisting in the mission. The MWD team is not in charge of the health and welfare
inspection but can be used as a tool by the commander.
