Health Precautions and Guidelines
During First Aid Training
The American Red Cross has trained millions of people in fi rst aid and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using manikins as training aids.
The Red Cross follows widely accepted guidelines for cleaning and decontaminating training manikins.
If these guidelines are adhered to, the risk of any kind of disease transmission during
training is extremely low.
To help minimize the risk of disease transmission, you should follow some basic health precautions and
guidelines while participating in training. You should take precautions if you have a condition that would
increase your risk or other participants’ risk of exposure to infections. Request a separate training manikin
if you—
■ Have an acute condition, such as a cold, a sore throat, or cuts or sores on the hands or around your mouth.
■ Know you are seropositive (have had a positive blood test) for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
indicating that you are currently infected with the hepatitis B virus.*
■ Know you have a chronic infection indicated by long-term seropositivity (long-term positive blood tests)
for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)* or a positive blood test for anti-HIV (that is, a positive test for
antibodies to HIV, the virus that causes many severe infections including AIDS).
■ Have had a positive blood test for hepatitis C (HCV).
■ Have a type of condition that makes you unusually likely to get an infection.
To obtain information about testing for individual health status, visit the CDC Web site at:
www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/c/faq.htm
After a person has had an acute hepatitis B infection, he or she will no longer test positive for the surface
antigen but will test positive for the hepatitis B antibody (anti-HBs). Persons who have been vaccinated
for hepatitis B will also test positive for the hepatitis antibody. A positive test for the hepatitis B antibody
(antiHBs) should not be confused with a positive test for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG).
If you decide you should have your own manikin, ask your instructor if he or she can provide
one for you to use. You will not be asked to explain why in your request. The manikin will not be used
by anyone else until it has been cleaned according to the recommended end-of-class decont amination
procedures. Because the number of manikins available for class use is limited, the more advance notice
you give, the more likely it is that you can be provided a separate manikin.
*A person with hepatitis B infection will test positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Most persons infected with hepatitis B
will get better within a period of time. However, some hepatitis B infections will become chronic and will linger for much longer. These
persons will continue to test positive for HBsAg. Their decision to participate in CPR training should be guided by their physician.
viii First Aid/CPR/AED | Participant’s Manual

Some people are sensitive to certain allergens and may have an allergic reaction. If you start experiencing
skin redness, rash, hives, itching, runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, scratchy throat or signs of asthma, wash
your hands immediately. If conditions persist or you experience a severe reaction, stop training and seek
medical attention right away.
GUIDELINES
In addition to taking the precautions regarding manikins, you can further protect yourself and other
participants from infection by following these guidelines:
■ Wash your hands thoroughly before participating in class activities.
■ Do not eat, drink, use tobacco products or chew gum during class when manikins are used.
■ Clean the manikin properly before use.
■ For some manikins, this means vigorously wiping the manikin’s face and the inside of its mouth with a
clean gauze pad soaked with either a fresh solution of liquid chlorine bleach and water (1⁄ cup sodium
4
hypochlorite per gallon of tap water) or rubbing alcohol. The surfaces should remain wet for at least
1 minute before they are wiped dry with a second piece of clean, absorbent material.
■ For other manikins, it means changing the manikin’s face. Your instructor will provide you with
instructions for cleaning the type of manikin used in your class.
■ Follow the guidelines provided by your instructor when practicing skills such as clearing a blocked airway
with your fi nger.
PHYSICAL STRESS AND INJURY
Successful course completion requires full participation in classroom and skill sessions, as well as successful
performance in skill and knowledge evaluations. Due to the nature of the skills in this course, you will be
participating in strenuous activities, such as performing CPR on the fl oor. If you have a medical condition or
disability that will prevent you from taking part in the skills practice sessions, please let your instructor know
so that accommodations can be made. If you are unable to participate fully in the course, participate as much
as you can or desire. Be aware that you will not be eligible to receive a course completion certifi cate unless
you participate fully and meet all course objectives and prerequisites.

CHAPTER
Before Giving Care and Checking
an Injured or Ill Person
M
edical emergencies can happen every day, in any setting. People are injured in situations like falls or
motor-vehicle accidents, or they develop sudden illnesses, such as heart attack or stroke.
The statistics are sobering. For example, about 900,000 people in the United States die each year from some
form of heart disease. More than 300,000 of these deaths are caused by sudden cardiac arrest. Heart disease is the
number one cause of death in this country.
Another leading cause of death is unintentional injury. In 2008, approximately 118,000 Americans died from an
unintentional injury and another 25.7 million were disabled.
Given the large number of injuries and sudden illnesses that occur in the United States each year, it is possible that you
might have to deal with an emergency situation someday. If you do, you should know who and when to call, what care
to give and how to give that care until emergency medical help takes over.
This chapter discusses your role in the emergency medical services (EMS) system, the purpose of Good Samaritan laws,
how to gain consent from an injured or ill person and how to reduce your risk of disease transmission while giving care.
In addition, you will read about the emergency action steps, CHECK—CALL—CARE, which guide you on how to
check and give emergency care for an injured or suddenly ill person. You also will read about the effects of incident
stress and how to identify the signals of shock and minimize its effects.
CHAPTER 1 | Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 1

Step 3: Activate the EMS system.
Step 4: Give care until help takes over.
Step 1: Recognize that an Emergency
Exists
Emergencies can happen to anyone, anywhere.
Before you can give help, however, you must be able
to recognize an emergency. You may realize that an
emergency has occurred only if you become aware
of unusual noises, sights, odors and appearances or
behaviors. Examples include the following:
■ Unusual noises

CARE
Once you have checked the scene and the person and have
made a decision about calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency
number, you may need to give care until EMS personnel
take over. After making the 9-1-1 call, immediately go
back to the injured or ill person. Check the person for
life-threatening conditions and give the necessary care
(see Checking a Conscious and Unconscious Person section

CHAPTER
Cardiac Emergencies and CPR
C
ardiac emergencies are life threatening. Heart attack and cardiac arrest are major causes of illness and death
in the United States. Every day in U.S. homes, parks and workplaces someone will have a heart attack or
go into cardiac arrest. Recognizing the signals of a heart attack and cardiac arrest, calling 9-1-1 or the local
emergency number and giving immediate care in a cardiac emergency saves lives. Performing CPR and using an
automated external defi brillator (AED) immediately after a person goes into cardiac arrest can greatly increase his
or her chance of survival.
In this chapter you will fi nd out what signals to look for if you suspect a person is having a heart attack or has gone into
cardiac arrest. This chapter also discusses how to care for a person having a heart attack and how to perform CPR for a
person in cardiac arrest. In addition, this chapter covers the important links in the Cardiac Chain of Survival.
Although cardiac emergencies occur more commonly in adults, they also occur in infants and children. This chapter
discusses the causes of cardiac arrest and how to provide care for all age groups.
CHAPTER 2 | Cardiac Emergencies and CPR 29

BACKGROUND
The heart is a fascinating organ. It beats more than 3
billion times in an average lifetime. The heart is about
the size of a fi st and lies between the lungs in the middle
of the chest. It pumps blood throughout the body. The
ribs, breastbone and spine protect it from injury. The
heart is separated into right and left halves (Fig. 2-1).
Arteries of the heart
Blood that contains little or no oxygen enters the right
side of the heart and is pumped to the lungs. The blood
picks up oxygen in the lungs when you breathe. The
oxygen-rich blood then goes to the left side of the heart
and is pumped from the heart’s blood vessels, called the
arteries, to all other parts of the body. The heart and
your body’s vital organs need this constant supply of
oxygen-rich blood.
Cardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that
affects the heart and blood vessels. An estimated 80
million Americans suffer from some form of the disease.
It remains the number one killer in the United States

adults who die each year from cardiovascular disease.
When the heart is working normally, it beats evenly
and easily, with a steady rhythm. When damage to the
heart causes it to stop working effectively, a person
can experience a heart attack or other damage to the
heart muscle. A heart attack can cause the heart to
beat in an irregular way. This may prevent blood from

minutes or goes away and comes back. If you suspect the
person is having a heart attack based on his or her signals,
call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. A
person having a heart attack probably will deny that any
signal is serious. Do not let this infl uence you. If you think
the person might be having a heart attack, act quickly.
What to Do Until Help Arrives
It is important to recognize the signals of a heart attack
and to act on those signals. Any heart attack might lead
to cardiac arrest, but prompt action may prevent further
damage to the heart. A person suffering from a heart
attack, and whose heart is still beating, has a far better
chance of living than does a person whose heart has
stopped. Most people who die of a heart attack die within
2 hours of the fi rst signal. Many could have been saved if
people on the scene or the person having the heart attack
had been aware of the signals and acted promptly.
Many people who have heart attacks delay seeking care.
Nearly half of all heart attack victims wait for 2 hours

■ Give 30 chest compressions. Push hard, push fast
at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute.
Note that the term “100 compressions per minute”
refers to the speed of compressions, not the number
of compressions given in a minute. As you give
compressions, count out loud, “One and two and
three and four and fi ve and six and…” up to
30. Push down as you say the number and come up
as you say “and.” This will help you to keep a steady,
even rhythm.
■ Give compressions by pushing the sternum
down at least 2 inches (Fig. 2-9, A). The downward
and upward movement should be smooth, not
jerky. Push straight down with the weight of
your upper body, not with your arm muscles.
This way, the weight of your upper body will
create the force needed to compress the chest.

S
udden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating normally because of abnormal electrical
activity of the heart. Every year in the United States more than 300,000 people die of sudden cardiac arrest.
Sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone, anytime without warning but usually occurs in adults. Most
cardiac arrests happen in the home. Therefore, knowing how to activate the emergency medical services (EMS)
system, perform CPR and use an automated external defi brillator (AED) could help you save a life—most likely
someone you love.
This chapter further discusses the third link in the Cardiac Chain of Survival: early defi brillation, including what
it is and how it works in the case of life-threatening abnormal electrical activity of the heart. You also will read
about the steps to follow when using an AED. This knowledge will give you the confi dence to give care to anyone
who experiences sudden cardiac arrest.
CHAPTER 3 | AED 45

WHEN THE HEART
SUDDENLY FAILS
The heart’s electrical system sends out signals that tell
the heart to pump blood. These signals travel through
the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria, to the
lower chambers, called the ventricles.
When the heart is normal and healthy, these electrical
signals cause the ventricles to squeeze together, or
contract. These contractions force blood out of the heart.
The blood then circulates throughout the body. When
the ventricles relax between contractions, blood fl ows
back into the heart. The pause that you notice between FIGURE 3-1 There are several types of AEDs.

USING AN AED

Also, use an AED as soon as it is available and ready to

Breathing Emergencies
A
breathing emergency is any respiratory problem that can threaten a person’s life. Breathing emergencies
happen when air cannot travel freely and easily into the lungs. Respiratory distress, respiratory arrest and
choking are examples of breathing emergencies. In a breathing emergency, seconds count so you must react
at once. This chapter discusses how to recognize and care for breathing emergencies.

Fortunately, most of the bleeding you will encounter
will not be serious. In most cases it usually stops by
itself within a few minutes with minimal intervention.
The trauma may cause a blood vessel to tear causing
bleeding, but the blood at the wound site usually clots
quickly and stops fl owing. Sometimes, however, the
damaged blood vessel is too large or the pressure in
the blood vessel is too great for the blood to clot, then
bleeding can be life threatening. This can happen with
both closed and open wounds.
Closed Wounds
The simplest closed wound is a bruise. A bruise develops
when the body is bumped or hit, such as when you bump
your leg on a table or chair (Fig. 7-2). The force of the blow
to the body damages the soft tissue layers beneath the skin. FIGURE 7-2 The simplest closed wound is a bruise, which develops

until advised to do so by a medical professional.
Open Wounds
In an open wound, the break in the skin can be as
minor as a scrape of the surface layers or as severe
as a deep penetration. The amount of bleeding
depends on the location and severity of the injury.
The four main types of open soft tissue wounds are
abrasions, lacerations, avulsions and punctures.
Abrasions
FIGURE 7-3 Apply ice to a closed wound to help control pain and swelling. Abrasions are the most common type of open
wound (Fig. 7-4). They usually are caused by
something rubbing roughly against the skin.
Abrasions do not bleed much. Any bleeding that
occurs comes from capillaries (tiny blood vessels).
Dirt and germs frequently have been rubbed into
this type of wound, which is why it is important
to clean and irrigate an abrasion thoroughly with
soap and water to prevent infection.
Other terms for an abrasion include a scrape, a
rug burn, a road rash or a strawberry. Abrasions
usually are painful because scraping of the outer
skin layers exposes sensitive nerve endings.
Lacerations
A laceration is a cut in the skin, which commonly
is caused by a sharp object, such as a knife,
scissors or broken glass (Fig. 7-5). A laceration
also can occur when a blunt force splits the
skin. Deep lacerations may cut layers of fat and
muscle, damaging both nerves and blood vessels.
Bleeding may be heavy or there may be none at
all. Lacerations are not always painful because
damaged nerves cannot send pain signals to the
brain. Infection can easily occur with lacerations

What to Do Until Help Arrives
Give general care for all open wounds.
Specifi c care depends on whether the
person has a minor or a major open wound.
General Care for Open Wounds
General care for open wounds includes
controlling bleeding, preventing infection
and using dressings and bandages.
Preventing Infection
When the skin is broken, the best initial
defense against infection is to clean the
area. For minor wounds, after controlling
any bleeding, wash the area with soap and
water and, if possible, irrigate with large
amounts of fresh running water to remove
debris and germs. You should not wash
more serious wounds that require medical
attention because they involve more
extensive tissue damage or bleeding and it
is more important to control the bleeding.
Sometimes even the best care for a soft

or crushing of the extremity, the bleeding may be hard
to control.
Punctures
Punctures usually occur when a pointed object,
such as a nail, pierces the skin (Fig. 7-7). A gunshot
wound is a puncture wound. Puncture wounds do
not bleed much unless a blood vessel has been injured.
However, an object that goes into the soft tissues
beneath the skin can carry germs deep into the body.
These germs can cause infections—sometimes serious
ones. If the object remains in the wound, it is called an
embedded object.

Chest Injuries
The chest is the upper part of the trunk. It is shaped by
12 pairs of ribs. Ten of the pairs attach to the sternum
(breastbone) in front and to the spine in back. Two pairs,
the fl oating ribs, attach only to the spine. The rib cage,
formed by the ribs, the sternum and the spine, protects
vital organs, such as the heart, major blood vessels and
the lungs. Also in the chest are the esophagus, trachea
and muscles used for respiration.
Chest injuries are a leading cause of trauma deaths each
year. Injuries to the chest may result from a wide variety
of causes, such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports
mishaps and crushing or penetrating forces. Chest
injuries may involve the bones that form the chest cavity
or the organs or other structures in the cavity itself.
Chest wounds may be either closed or open. A closed

Injuries to Muscles, Bones

I
n juries to muscles, bones and joints happen to people of all ages at home, work and play. A person may fall while
walking in the park and bruise the muscles of a leg. Equipment may fall on a worker and break bones. A skier may fall
and twist a leg, tearing muscles in the process.
These injuries are painful and make life diffi cult, but they seldom are life threatening. However, if they are not
recognized and care is not given, they can cause serious problems. In the rare case of a head, neck or spinal injury,
lifelong disability, or even death, can result if immediate care is not given.
This chapter discusses the signals of muscle, bone and joint injuries and how to give care for these injuries. In addition,
you will read about how to recognize head, neck and spinal injuries, and how to give immediate, potentially life-saving
care in these situations.

Splinting an Injury
Splinting is a method of immobilizing an injured part
to minimize movement and prevent further injury and
should be used only if you have to move or transport
the person to seek medical attention and if it does not
cause more pain. Splint an injury in the position in
which you fi nd it. For fractures, splint the joints above FIGURE 8-11 Folded blankets, towels, pillows or a triangular

injuries, splint the bones above and below the site of
the injury. If you are not sure if the injury is a fracture
or a sprain, splint both the bones and joints above and
below the point of injury. Splinting materials should
be soft or padded for comfort. Check for circulation
(feeling, warmth and color) before and after splinting to
make sure that the splint is not too tight.
There are many methods of splinting, including:
■ Anatomic splints. The person’s body is the splint.
For example, you can splint an arm to the chest or an
injured leg to the uninjured leg (Fig. 8-10).

After you have splinted the injury, apply ice to the
injured area. Keep the person from getting chilled or
overheated and be reassuring.
Head, Neck and Spinal Injuries
Although head, neck and spinal injuries make up only
a small fraction of all injuries, these injuries may be life
threatening or cause permanent life-altering damage.
Each year, approximately 12,000 Americans suffer
a spinal cord injury. Most are male victims with an
average age of about 40 years. The leading causes of
spinal cord injuries are motor vehicle crashes, followed
by falls, violence and sports (Fig. 8-13).
Injuries to the head, neck or spine can cause paralysis,
speech or memory problems or other disabling
conditions. These injuries can damage bone and soft
tissue, including the brain and spinal cord. Since
generally only x-rays, CAT scans or MRIs can show the
severity of a head, neck or spinal injury, you should FIGURE 8-14 Injuries to the head

severe allergic reaction can bring on a condition called anaphylaxis, also known as anaphylactic
shock. Anaphylaxis can quickly cause trouble breathing. It is a life-threatening emergency that must be
recognized and cared for immediately.
In this chapter you will learn to identify the signals of anaphylaxis. You also will learn what care to give to a person
in anaphylactic shock. Part of giving care may mean helping the person use an epinephrine auto-injector.

ANAPHYLAXIS
Every year in the United States, between 400 and
800 deaths are caused by anaphylaxis. Respond quickly
if a person is exposed to an antigen—a foreign substance
that brings on an allergic reaction. Fortunately, some
deaths can be prevented if anaphylaxis is recognized
immediately and cared for quickly.
Allergic Reactions
Allergic reactions are caused by the activity of the
immune system. The body recognizes and protects itself
from antigens by producing antibodies. These antibodies
