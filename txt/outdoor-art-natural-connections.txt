Naturally Connected Curriculum Project
OUTDOOR ART
Who are these resources for? Natural Connections resources are aimed at teachers who
are new to outdoor learning and are intended as an initial helping hand to get started.
Teachers with more experience in taking lessons outside will be able to adapt them and take
them to the next level. Resources are available to cover all subjects of the KS1 and KS2 new
national curriculum.
Why were they produced? These resources were produced in response to teachers’
feedback via the Natural Connections Demonstration Project.<hyperlink to landing page>
The 3 ½ year project aims to increase learning in natural environments across in schools
across the south west, and draws valuable learning from evaluation of the delivery model
and the diverse benefits of using local green spaces for education across the curriculum.
Many of the teachers involved in the project were new to taking learning outdoors, and
requested some simple lesson ideas to help build their confidence and to link outdoor
learning to the curriculum. These resources have been produced by Plymouth University’s
Institute of Education, and have been trialled in Natural Connections schools.
Can I get involved with Natural Connections? The Demonstration Project element of
Natural Connections concludes in March 2016 but a number of legacy initiatives are under
development. Natural Connections has been working with over 120 schools since 2012 in
the South West and we are now able to offer our service to all schools.
The Natural Connections Team can support all aspects of outdoor learning in primary,
secondary and special schools throughout the UK and overseas. We are an experienced
group of experts in curriculum development and outdoor learning practice across all
curriculum topics. We draw on a range of specialists to tailor our services to the particular
needs of each school. Our service to schools includes:
- Specialist professional development & training for teaching staff, governors and
volunteers
- Bespoke Curriculum design to integrate outdoor learning into learning, teaching and
Improvement Plans
- Practical outdoor learning activities and ideas to support lessons that engage pupils,
develop skills, enhance attainment and offer creative lesson ideas

ART DISCOVERING EXPERIMENTING TALKING AND LISTENING
Subject: Art
‘Wizard and Witches Potions’
Year 1/2 Year 3/4 Year 5/6
NATURAL CURRICULUM OBJECTIVE(S): ART Key Stage 1
 to use a range of materials creatively to design and make products
 to develop a wide range of art and design techniques in using colour, pattern, texture, line,
shape, form and space.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE(S):
 I can use my senses to make my own paint from natural materials
TIMESCALE:
1 lesson (1 hour)
ACTIVITY:
This activity is particularly appealing to young children, especially if you can link it to a story that
involves witches and wizards, e.g. Room on the Broom by Julia Donaldson or Harry Potter, etc.
Children are encouraged to explore the outdoor environment and collect natural materials from
around the school grounds – mud, grass, daisies, bark from a tree, leaves, etc and put into their own
individual pot (yogurt pot/plastic pot).
Children can have fun exploring the outdoor, natural environment and inspire curiosity and
creativity by seeing who can make the strangest potion, the prettiest potion, the smelliest potion,
etc.
Then you can add PVA glue to their potion and they can stir it up and paint a picture with their
concoction.
EAL/SEN:
A very active, practical lesson. Lots of opportunities to work alongside peers and adults.
Opportunities for speaking and listening for EAL. Appealing for SEN due to lots of touching and
feeling of resources and the practical element.

 I can discover a range of different natural materials to make a beautiful
piece of art.
TIMESCALE:
1 lesson or a series (1 hour)
ACTIVITY:
This activity is fun as it has a fun factor or being a detective. Tell the children they have a mission to
explore the outside environment (if lacking add a lot of things to find, e.g. pine cones, leaves,
flowers, shells, etc.) and discover some materials to make art with.
They may wish to use a camera and photograph what they view as art, they may wish to collect a lot
of objects and draw them or use them – glue them onto a scrap book, they may want to make a
sculpture out of stones or a building out of sticks.
Inspire the children with some ideas, but also encourage them to use their own imagination.
You can photograph and copy their work and produce a detectives’ line up of art.

ART THE PROCESS OFTIE-DYE DESIGNING
Subject: Art
‘Tie-Dye with Natural Materials’
Year 1/2 Year 3/4 Year 5/6
NATURAL CURRICULUM OBJECTIVE(S): ART Key Stage 2
 Pupils should be taught to develop their techniques, including their control and their use of
materials, with creativity, experimentation and an increasing awareness of different kinds of
art, craft and design.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE(S):
 I can design and colour a piece of clothing using natural materials
TIMESCALE:
1 lesson (1 hour) + leaving it to soak and visiting it another lesson, perhaps
to do further work on it.
ACTIVITY:
Children can explore the natural environment and select a plant, fruit or flower to provide the colour
for their tie-dye.
Using a cotton t-shirt/material they can help to make the mixture that is needed to tie-dye the
material and also design where they want the pattern to be on their material.
There are many ‘how to’ videos online and the Eden Project provides a great step by step
instruction.
Natural materials that produce a good colour are: blackberries, carrot leaves, grass cuttings, onion
skins, red cabbage, blueberries, raspberries, etc.
EAL/SEN:
A very active, practical lesson. Lots of opportunities to work alongside peers and adults.
Opportunities for speaking and listening for EAL. Appealing for SEN due to lots of touching and

ART WORKING WITH CLAY DESIGNING CR AFT SKILLS
‘Woodland Clay Sculptures’
Year 1/2 Year 3/4 Year 5/6
NATURAL CURRICULUM OBJECTIVE(S): ART Key Stage 2
 Pupils should be taught to develop their techniques, including their control and their use of
materials, with creativity, experimentation and an increasing awareness of different kinds of
art, craft and design.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE(S):
 I can use clay to produce a woodland animal to decorate our
School grounds.
TIMESCALE:
1 or 2 lessons.
ACTIVITY:
Clay is a very natural material and due to its messy nature it is very suitable for working with outside
of the classroom. On the school field will be very manageable if every child took a board with them
and if it’s a sunny day the clay can be left to dry outside too!
A woodland theme where children can design their clay into owls, squirrels, foxes, badgers,
mushrooms, leaves, etc. looks very appealing around the school grounds and also fits into the
natural environment well, especially if your school has trees and lots of greenery.
Children can pound, pinch, roll, flatten, poke, tear, squeeze, coil, stretch, squash, twist, and bend
their clay into all sorts of shapes and sizes. Making it a really enjoyable material to work with.
Ask children if they know where clay comes from? How it is made?
EAL/SEN:
Working with the clay will provide a good break from using pencils, crayons, paint brushes, or other
tools as the children are all free to express themselves and take their time over making what they
would like. A very active, practical lesson. Opportunities for speaking and listening for EAL. Appealing
for SEN due to lots of touching and feeling of resources and the practical element.
DIFFERENTIATION:
HA children – gifted and talented at Art and sculpting could be asked to make a solid 3D clay model
to extend their skills. Provide them with different tools to use with the clay instead of just their
hands. Different texture clay. Question children – what is working well? How could you make the

ART WORKING WITH WILLOW DESIGNING CRAFT SKILLS
Subject: Art
‘Working with Willow’
Year 1/2 Year 3/4 Year 5/6
NATURAL CURRICULUM OBJECTIVE(S): ART Key Stage 2
 Pupils should be taught to develop their techniques, including their control and their use of
materials, with creativity, experimentation and an increasing awareness of different kinds of
art, craft and design.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE(S):
 I can plan, design and build a willow structure.
TIMESCALE:
Ongoing art project – 4 or 5 lessons.
ACTIVITY:
This requires an expert coming into school – which can be costly, but it is very worth it as the
products made are beautiful for the school grounds and can then go on to be used in the playground
thereafter for Forest School projects and outdoor learning.
Willow structures such as domes, tunnels and arbours can be constructed. Children are encouraged
to be fully involved in the process of planning, designing and building their structure giving them a
real sense of achievement when the project is completed.
EAL/SEN:
A very active, practical lesson. Opportunities for speaking and listening for EAL. Learning a new skill.
Appealing for SEN due to lots of touching and feeling of resources and the practical element.

ART GARDENING PLANTING DESIGNING LIFE CYCLES OF PLANTS
Subject: Art
‘Art and Gardening’
Year 1/2 Year 3/4 Year 5/6
NATURAL CURRICULUM OBJECTIVE(S): ART Key Stage 2
 Pupils should be taught to develop their techniques, including their control and their use of
materials, with creativity, experimentation and an increasing awareness of different kinds of
art, craft and design.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE(S):
 I can plan, design and create a garden landscape.
TIMESCALE:
Ongoing art/gardening project –4- 5 lessons. Plus continued maintenance
to the garden.
ACTIVITY:
Children can be given a small flowerbed in groups or be designated a small area of the school
grounds to plan, design and plant. With art and design at the forefront of their minds children will be
asked to consider colour, texture, shape and the structure of their garden.
Do they want to evoke the senses? Smell, touch, taste. A herb garden for example, or a rainbow
garden. Children can keep an art sketch book of their plans, cuttings of the plants they grow,
photographs of the development. Consider who is it for?
EAL/SEN:
A very active, practical lesson. Opportunities for speaking and listening for EAL. Learning gardening
skills. Appealing for SEN due to lots of touching and feeling of resources and the practical element.
DIFFERENTIATION: HA children to consider the art and design factor of creating a landscape/flower
bed more significantly. Designs and diagrams to have elaborate labels, a project where children can
investigate what plants grow well together, look nice together. To make it more artistic make a
colour pallet of all the colours used in their garden or create a small art sculpture to sit in amongst
the plants.
