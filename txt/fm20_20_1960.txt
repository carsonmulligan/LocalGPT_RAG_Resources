CHAPTER 1
GENERAL
1. Purpose and Scope
This manual is a guide for training dogs for scout and sentry
duty with the United States Arniy. It includes instructions on
selecting, training, and caring for dogs and describes the qualities
needed by dog handlers.
2. The Dog Handler
To effectively train military dogs, a handler must know more
than just the principles of dog training. The effective handler is
one who-
a. Has a sound understanding of the way a dog's mind works.
b. Is able, through a knowledge of grooming, feeding, kenneling,
and first aid, to keep a dog in the physical condition required for
performance with maximum efficiency.
c. Can properly employ the military dog to accomplish assigned
missions.
3. Assignment and Attachment of the Scout Dog Platoon
a. As organized, the infantry scout dog platoon (fig. 1) must be
attached or assigned to a larger unit for mess, supply, and adminis-
trative support. The platoon is generally assigned to an army and
is further attached to a division. Elements of the platoon or indi-
vidual handlers and their dogs may be attached to lower echelons,
including frontline battle groups and companies, for specific mis-
sions or periods.
b. Sentry dog handlers and teams are authorized by TOE aug-
mentation or by TD. The size of sentry dog units will vary, depend-
ing upon the size of the area to be protected and the vulnerability
and sensitivity of the activity to be protected.

CHAPTER 2
TRAITS AND CARE OF MILITARY DOGS
Section I. DOG BREED AND CHARACTERISTICS
4. General
The dog's world differs from that of humans in some very specific
ways. His world is mostly one of odors. His nose tells him count-
less things about his environment which entirely escape humans.
He is more sensitive to sounds than humans. His visual sensitivity
to the movement of objects is superior to that of humans. The dog's
senses which concern the trainer chiefly are, in the sequence of
their probable importance, smell, hearing, vision, and touch.
5. Breed
a. The German Shepherd is the only breed acceptable for train-
ing as military scout and sentry dogs.
b. The German Shepherd is a working dog of'wolflike appear-
ance, with a medium-size, muscular body. He has a double coat to
protect him in all kinds of weather; a harsh, straight outer coat
of medium length, and a dense, wooly undercoat. His color may
range from black to white, but the most characteristic color is wolf-
gray. For military uses, his coat should be on the dark side.
c. The special traits that make the German Shepherd so desir-
able as a military dog are his outstandingly keen nose, endurance,
reliability, speed, power, courage, and temperament.
6. Senses
a. Smell.
(1) Dogs so far surpass man in keenness of smell that it is
difficult to imagine the nature of the smell sensations they
receive. Just as it is probably impossible for a dog to
imagine what colors are, so it is impossible for man to
conceive of the vast range of odors and delicate differ-
ences in chemical shading to which a dog is so sensitive.
The dog's nose is ideally adapted for the detection of
minute amounts of odorous particles. It is kept moist by
a glandular secretion and is extremely sensitive to slight
currents of air. On feeling such a current, a dog turns
AGO 5344B 5

his head into the wind, clears his nostrils, and sniffs.-A
generous sample of the air passes into the nasal cavity
and over the mucous membrane which is richly supplied
with the finely subdivided endings of the olfactory nerves.
This mucous membrane is supported on a complexly con-
voluted bony structure. Its structure is such as to present
a maximum surface with a minimum obstruction to the
circulation of air. By comparison,. the human olfactory
apparatus is crude, yet even the human nose can detect
chemicals borne by the air in such minute quantity that
they cannot be identified by the most sensitive chemical
tests. In general, studies show that dogs can respond to
odor traces of all known sorts and in dilutions far more
extreme than can be detected by man. Furthermore, they
can distinguish many odors which seem identical to
human beings.
(2) A dog's trailing ability depends upon certain traits in
addition to his sense of smell. Almost any German Shep-
herd has a good enough sense of smell to become a good
trailer, but it is only the exceptional dog that can be
trained to follow slowly and carefully any trail his master
sets him on, regardless of any diversion or olfactory ruse
he may encounter. Any Shepherd can trail a rabbit or
a woodchuck. Only a few will, on command, follow the
trail of a stranger leading through traffic, under snow,
near a kennel full of dogs, or past a woodchuck hole.
(3) Tests indicate that a dog's success in trailing depends pri-
marily upon his accurate discrimination of-
(a) Earth odor from the compression of those spots stepped
on by his quarry.
(b) Plant odor from the vegetation bruised or broken by his
quarry.
(c) Odor traces from shoes and shoe polish.
(d) Odor traces from decaying animal or other organic
matter.
(e) Body odor specific to any particular person.
(4) Visual cues are of slight assistance to him.
b. Hearing.
(1) Tests have been conducted to prove that a dog hears
sounds too faint to affect human ears. Also, the dog hears
sounds of higher pitch than can a human.
(2) In using a dog's sense of hearing to assist in his training,
you will find that voice inflection as well as the sound of
the actual words affects his understanding of oral com-
6
AGO 5344B

mands. Some dogs appear to understand most accurately
the feeling and wishes of the handler as they are conveyed
by his voice. A word spoken in an encouraging tone will
elate these dogs; a cross word will depress them. If it is
intended to use a dog at night or under any circumstances
where he cannot see his handler, it is important to train
him to respond to a number of oral commands. Some dogs
cannot be reached through their sense of hearing. They
are not considered suitable for military training.
c. Vision. A most striking difference between the retina of a
dog's eye and that of a human is that the dog's retina lacks a fovea
centralis, which is a small rodless area of the retina that affords
acute vision. When a man focuses his eyes upon any object, the
light reflected from that object is thrown upon the fovea centralis.
He can see many other objects-besides that one, but he sees them
indistinctly. This can be tested readily enough by focusing the eyes
upon any word on this printed page and then trying to see how
many other words can be read without moving the eyes. The words
reflected upon the nonfoveal portions of the retina are blurred and
poorly defined. Since a dog lacks a fovea centralis, one may expect
that even an object upon which he focuses is seen less clearly than
it would be by humans.
(1) Perceptiono f movement. This is a type of visual stimula-
tion to which dogs seem very sensitive. If an object is
moved ever so slightly, most dogs will detect and respond
to the movement. Dogs make little use of their eyes in
learning except for their perception of movement.
(2) Color vision. Experimental evidence supports the opinion
that to dogs the world looks like a black and white photo-
graph.
d. Touch. There is a wide variation among dogs in their respon-
siveness to the sense of touch. Certain dogs are very susceptible
to manual caress or correction. Others appear to be relatively in-
sensitive to it.
7. Aggressiveness
The degree of aggressiveness in a military dog is judged almost
solely by his disposition to attack. In general, a dog which is rated
underaggressive cannot be taught to attack. A dog of average
aggressiveness can be taught to attack, though less readily, than
an animal rated as overaggressive. The only difficulty with an
overly aggressive dog is getting him to stop an attack promptly
on command.
AGO 5S44B 7

8. Sensitivity
The term "sensitivity" refers to the type and degree of response
a dog shows to certain stimuli (sound and touch). An oversensitive
dog is startled by stimuli of lower intensity than is required to dis-
turb the average dog. He often responds to weak stimuli by trem-
bling and cowering or fleeing. A normal dog might react to the
same stimuli with a mere turn of his head.
a. Oversensitive Dog. A dog that is oversensitive (shy) is so
handicapped that it is not likely to demonstrate what intelligence
it possesses in a form which the trainer can utilize. A dog that is
shy to either sound or touch is difficult to train and is unreliable.
A dog that shows a mild degree of gun shyness can sometimes be
accustomed to gunfire through repeated exposure to it, but he can-
not always be depended on where reliability in the face of noise is
a matter of life or death. In general, an oversensitive animal can be
trained only with difficulty, if at all, and it cannot be trusted
implicitly.
b. Undersensitive Dog. A dog that is undersensitive to both
sound and touch is also very difficult to train. A handler cannot
"reach" him readily to give either correction or caress. A dog that
is sensitive to either sound or touch, but not to both, can be in-
structed readily enough by a handler who discovers the right ap-
proach. The handler must employ his voice in one case and his
hands in another.
c. Ideal Sensitivity. The ideal dog from the standpoint of sensi-
tivity (that is, ideal in the hands of a good handler) is somewhat
sensitive to both sound and touch. Such a dog tends to do either
very well or rather poorly, depending on the wisdom used in han-
dling him. A mediocre handler may spoil him.
d. Importance of Handler. Certain men are unable to appeal to
a dog successfully through his ear because they do not have the
proper voice range and timbre, but they may have a certain finesse
in muscular control that enables them to obtain excellent results in
handling the dog manually. The opposite is also true. In general,
each handler succeeds best with a certain type dog and each dog
with a certain type handler. To gain maximum effectiveness, the
qualifications of the man must be matched with the sensory peculi-
arities of the dog.
9. Intelligence
a. Generally, intelligence is the trait most closely related to a
dog's success in military training and service. 'In intelligence, the
dog is far inferior to man, but probably superior to any other
8 AGO 56844B

animal below the primates.' A dog can be taught to respond appro-
priately to an extremely large number of spoken words. No one
knows the limit of his vocabulary. Under ordinary working condi-
tions, only about 20 words are needed, but some dogs have been
known to master responses to well over 100 oral commands.
b. A dog's rating for intelligence is based on the readiness with
which he learns and the extent to which he retains and uses what
he has learned. Intelligence is not related to the ease with which a
trainer gets a dog to conform to his commands. Certain dogs learn
very readily, when they want to, but are instructed with great diffi-
culty because they have a tendency to sulk or become stubborn in
obeying commands. A dog is rated high in intelligence if he is
capable of profiting by experience, regardless of whether this is to
the full satisfaction of the handler.
c. Some highly intelligent dogs are successful only when work-
ing with a man who pleases them. Under others they are unwilling
and give the appearance of being stupid.
10. Willingness
This term is an arbitrary one used to refer to a dog's reaction to
the commands of his handler. It applies not only to the way he
responds to a command or to an act that he has already learned,
but also to his cheerfulness and acceptance in learning new duties.
a. Willing Dog. A dog is ranked high in willingness if he per-
sistently responds to his master's commands with an effort to carry
them out, even though reward or correction is not immediate.
Whether the dog possesses the necessary intelligence or physical
strength, and whether he succeeds or fails, are not considered.
b. Unwilling Dog. If the promise of reward and the threat of
punishment must constantly be before a dog to make him work
properly, he is considered an unwilling worker. Many unwilling
dogs appear to make a nice distinction between work and play.
They will take great pleasure in retrieving, jumping, or searching
for objects. Such dogs, after responding only stubbornly during a
training period, will at times go to their handlers and apparently
suggest a romp which may include any of the acts mentioned. They
will then respond, promptly and appropriately, to commands to re-
trieve, search, jump, trail, etc. If, however, the situation is re-
versed and the handler initiates the play activity, these dogs may
not, in this case, respond promptly or appropriately.
c. Basic Considerations.
(1) Relation to handler. A few dogs will work willingly for
only certain people, often for only a single individual.
Most dogs show unwillingness when commanded by a
AGO 5344B 9

stranger. Some have proved to be stubborn regardless of
who trains and handles them. It is evident that the best
results are obtained when a dog and man are carefully
matched. A dog's rating for unwillingness should be only
in relation to his handler. A dog should be penalized in
his rating on this trait if he readily shifts his "willing-
ness" to another man; for example, to a stranger or
prisoner.
(2) Variances in willingness. Willingness can be enhanced or
inhibited by the man who handles a dog. Improper han-
dling may make a dog less willing at one time than at
another. Some dogs will work willingly during the first
5 minutes of a training period but, perhaps because of
impatience shown by the handler, the dog will show un-
willingness during the remainder of the period. Other
dogs, however, just naturally seem to become unwilling
after a few minutes. They should be rated relatively low
in this trait.
(3) Confusion with undersensitivity. Undersensitivity may
be confused with stubbornness. Certainly, a dog that is
undersensitive to both sound and touch may appear to
behave unwillingly when, as a matter of fact, the com-
mands supplied by the handler are less effective merely
because of the limitations of the dog's sensory system.
(4) Confusion with intelligence. When in doubt as to whether
a dog's refusal to perform learned tasks is due to stub-
bornness or forgetfulness, the dog should be confined to
the kennels for a few days. If he is merely stubborn, he
will then gladly run through his exercises for the privilege
of being at large.
11. Energy
This term refers to the degree of spontaneous activity of the
dog; that is, the speed and extent of his movements in general, not
in response to any command. Dogs differ greatly in this respect
and it is easier to rate their comparative energy than their other
traits. Above-average energy is desirable in a military dog because
it indicates good stamina.
Section II. SHIPMENT AND RECEPTION OF MILITARY DOGS
12. Shipment
All prospective military dogs are shipped by express at Govern-
ment expense in individual shipping crates (fig. 2) provided by
10 AGO 5344B

the Government. These crates are marked with shipping tags
which'carry the following information: the name of the dog, name
of the shipper, and the dog's destination. The shipper must get a
health certificate for the dog from a licensed veterinarian within
24 hours before shipment. State laws govern the manner in which
the certificate will be forwarded to the dog's destination. In all
cases where a dog is shipped overseas, a health certificate must
accompany the animal.
13. Reception and Recording Procedure
a. When a dog is taken from his shipping crate he is immediately
equipped with a leather collar. After being exercised on leash 'and
permitted to evacuate, he is put in quarantine for 21 days under
the supervision of the veterinarian. The veterinarian sees that he
is fed, watered, and left alone long enough for him to recover from
his journey and become accustomed to his surroundings.
b. During the two-week period following the dog's arrival the
following will be accomplished:
(1) Physical examination.
(2) Test for gun shyness.
(3) Test for man shyness.
(4) Test for aggressiveness.
(5) Test for ability to ride in wheeled vehicle without ill
effects.
(6) Branding (tatooing) of accepted dog.
(7) Return shipment of rejected dog.
14. Physical Examination
A newly arrived dog is given a while to rest, then he is taken to
the veterinarian where he is given a thorough physical examina-
tion, including X-rays to determine whether he has a coxofemoral
pathology (disease or abnormal condition of the hip and thigh
region). A dog that does not pass the physical examination is de-
clared unfit for military service and is returned to his owner.
15. Testing and Accustoming the Dog to Gunfire
a. A dog may be considered accustomed to gunfire when a small
caliber weapon can be fired directly above him without causing him
to flinch. Some dogs can never be trained to be steady under gun-
fire. Such dogs should be considered unfit for military training.
b. A dog can be accustomed to gunfire by discharging small
caliber weapons or exploding firecrackers from a distance, gradu-

ally decreasing the distance and firing progressively heavier caliber
weapons. It is best to start this training when the dog is engaged
in some activity which absorbs his attention, such as eating, or
during training periods. This will help him become subconsciously
accustomed to this type of noise. It has been found that the most
successful procedure in accustoming a dog to gunfire is to have the
shooting done as casually and intermittently as possible. When the
dog shows alarm, no attempt should be made to force him to sit
quietly while firing is repeated. It is better to discontinue firing for
the time being and resume when the dog has forgotten his alarm.
16. Test for Man-Shyness
If a dog trembles, whimpers, or is cowed at the approach of a
man, he is considered unfit for military service. The time and effort
required to break a dog of man-shyness is considered too great to
warrant retraining him.
17. Test for Aggressiveness
The test for aggressiveness amounts simply to finding out if a
dog responds appropriately to mild agitation. To do this, someone
approaches the dog and strikes him with a rolled gunny sack or
other harmless device. The dog should respond by growling, bark-
ing, or attempting to bite his tormentor. A dog that is frightened
by the agitator is considered unfit for military service.
18. Test for Ability to Ride in Vehicle
a. A dog may be considered carbroken when he enters a motor
vehicle on command, stays quietly within, and makes no attempt
to get out unless ordered to do so (fig. 3). A dog that cannot be-
come accustomed to riding in motor vehicles should be considered
unfit for military service.
b. (1) The commands UP and STAY are used to train a dog to
enter a vehicle and remain there. Upon noticing the first
symptoms of car sickness (a profuse flow of saliva and
drooling from lips and tongue, followed by gagging), the
instructor has the speed of the vehicle decreased and ob-
serves whether the symptoms continue. If the dog shows
improvement, speed can be gradually resumed. This pro-
cedure is repeated until the dog becomes accustomed to
the motion of the vehicle.
(2) If drooling continues when speed is diminished, the vehi-
cle is stopped and allowed to remain stationary until the
dog's behavior is normal. The tendency to be sick can
13
AGO 6344B

sometimes be checked by the handler speaking to the dog.
The vehicle can then be put into motion again, and this
procedure repeated as necessary.
(3) If symptoms of car sickness persist after following the
procedures in (1) and (2) above, try breaking the dog to
riding when his stomach is empty.
c. (1) In subsequent exercises, the length of the rides must be
progressively increased: 5 minutes the first day, 10 min-
utes the second, and so on until the dog shows no evidence
of car sickness, no matter how far he travels. The speed
of the vehicle should also be varied.
(2) When the dog can ride as shown in figure 3 without be-
coming car sick, place him in a shipping crate, load crate
and dog on the vehicle, and train the dog to ride this way
by the procedure prescribed in b above.
14
AGO 5344B

19. Tattooing Procedure
a. After the dog has been accepted and is purchased, he is tat-
tooed with a Preston brand number on the inside of the left rear leg.
b. Using the Preston branding system, it is possible to tattoo
4,000 animals with each letter assigned, in the following manner:
if the letter "A" is to be used, the first animal tattooed will receive
the tattoo "A000," the second "A001," the third "A002," and so on
up to "A999," which makes the first thousand. The second thousand
will be tattooed "OAOO," "OA01," "0A02," and so on up to "9A99."
The third thousand will be tattooed "OOAO," "OOA1," "00A2," and
so on up to "99A9." The fourth thousand will be tattooed "000A,"
"001A," "002A," and so on up to "999A."
c. Preston brand numbers are assigned by the Office of the
Quartermaster General.
20. Rejected Dogs
Dogs that are rejected for military service within 21 days after
they arrive are returned to their owners at Government expense.
Dogs that are not rejected during this period are paid for. If they
are rejected later, for any reason, they are disposed of through the
quartermaster property disposal officer.
Section III. KENNELING
21. Types of Kennels
a. Multiple. Multiple kennels (fig. 4) are used at permanent
installations, such as reception and training centers. They may be
used for housing and isolating newly received dogs.
b. Single. Single kennels (fig. 5) are used during training in the
field and at fixed installations. A single kennel usually has a hinged
top that can be raised to various heights, ranging from a few
inches for ventilation to a fully opened position for cleaning. It
may also have a detachable section to serve as a sunning and
grooming bench, provide shade, or furnish protection in wet
weather.
c. Field Kenneling.
(1) Kennel-type crate. During wartime or other large-scale
dog mobilization periods, 'a wide variety of crates may be
utilized, particularly for shipping dogs to training centers
from volunteer donors. A crate, regardless of type, should
not be destroyed by the receiving agency. It may be nec-
essary to use it for further transport or for housing. The
kennel-type crate (fig. 6) is normally used for shipping
a dog to a using agency in an overseas theater, but it is
15
AGO 5344B

Figure 4. Multiple kennel.
i a_\ i i L
Figure 5. Single kennels.
16 AGO 6844B

also designed to provide adequate temporary kenneling in
the field.
(2) Improvised kennel. Adequate kenneling in the field often
depends on the ingenuity of the handler. Palm leaves or
fir branches can be used to construct a crude protection
from sunlight and rain. In a damp climate, a dog bed
should be raised 6 to 10 inches above the ground. An
empty barrel makes an excellent kennel with an entrance
cut in one end and covered with a blanket, burlap sacling,
or some other available material. If desired, a porch with
a slanting roof may be added to provide further protec-
tion. The barrel is placed so that the bunghole is on top
and the hole is covered with a perforated housing to pro-
vide ventilation even in inclement weather.
Caution: The dog must not share the quarters of the
handler. It is human nature to make a pet of a dog, but
this will lead to the dog becoming familiar with too many
individuals and jeopardize the discipline that is developed
through training.
22. Kennel Arrangement and Identification
a. Kennels should be located in a well drained area that is readily
accessible to handlers and firefighting equipment and far enough
from heavy-traffic roads and areas of human activity and other
distractions to permit dogs a normal amount of rest.
b. Grass matting, salvage tenting, tarpaulin, or other material
should be stretched over the inclosures around the runs to provide
shade during hot weather.
c. To help prevent the dogs from disturbing one another, indi-
vidual kennels should not be placed face-to-face. They should be
so placed so that they receive the maximum benefit from sunlight
and other climatic conditions.
d. Sections of the kennel area and individual kennels should be
marked for identification. A kennel, for example, may bear the
following identification: "Section A, Kennel No. 8."
e. A kennel plan should be maintained to provide quick reference
to each dog's location, sick dogs, and vacant kennels.
23. Kennel Care
a. Kennels should be thoroughly cleaned each day to encourage
cleanliness in the dogs. They should be cleaned the first thing in
the morning. The kennel attendant must check the kennels from
time to time during the day and clean them again, when necessary.
17
AGO 5344B

He inspects them again after feeding and, at the end of the day, he
removes all feces again. The runways of permanent kennels should
be carefully hosed every day and the kennels should be scrubbed
thoroughly at least once a week. The importance of daily kennel
care cannot be overemphasized for it is the primary preventive
measure for continued good health of the dogs. Dirty kennels are
the main source of most of their communicable diseases.
b. Kennels should be examined for damage or wetness after
storms.
c. The ground around each kennel should be raked and gravel
added as required. In arctic or subarctic regions, the kennel floor
should be gravel, thus the dog's feet are toughened on gravel during
the summer months to prevent cutting on ice during the winter.
d. The bedding should be inspected, shaken up every day, and
changed at least once a week. Wet or damp straw should be re-
placed immediately with dry straw. Certain types of hay, par-
ticularly clover, prairie, and timothy make excellent bedding.
Straw has a tendency to mat or pack, whereas hay can readily be
fluffed up by the dog, thus creating a better nesting arrangement.
When a dog is moved from one kennel to another, the old bedding
Figure 6. Kennel-type shipping crate.
118 8 AAGGOO 56384444BB

should be removed and burned, and the kennel should be disin-
fected.
Section IV. GROOMING AND CARE
24. General
A dog must be groomed daily the year round. Grooming includes
inspection and care of ears, nails, nose, teeth, and the anal glands.
A good brushing keeps a dog clean and maintains his coat and skin
in a heathly condition. If his coat is brushed properly each day, it
is seldom necessary to bathe him. A dog must be kept free of fleas,
lice, and ticks. A dog's appearance denotes his state of health as
well as the care he receives and reflects directly on his handler.
25. Coat
a. German Shepherds have a double coat: the undercoat is com-
posed of soft, woolly hair and the outer coat is composed of coarse
hair, somewhat oily and water resistant. The coat offers protec-
tion from rain and excessive heat and cold.
b. It is important to give the coat a daily brushing. First, give
the dog a good brisk rubdown with the fingertips to loosen dead
skin. Follow the rubdown with a thorough but gentle brushing.
The coat should be brushed twice, first against and then with the
grain. This not only keeps the dog's coat clean and free from for-
eign matter but also polishes it and imparts a healthy, glowing
appearance. Combing, also, is important to good grooming; the
comb should be used with care to avoid damaging the dog's skin
and undercoat.
26. Nose
The nose must be inspected for cuts, scratches, and mucous dis-
charge. Cuts and scratches should be kept clean. In the case of a
persistent watery or thick discharge, the veterinarian should be
consulted. An excessively dry, hot, or moist nose is sometimes a
symptom of ill health.
27. Ears
a. Grooming always includes a daily inspection of the ear flaps
and ear canals and cleaning, if required. To clean the ear flaps, re-
move all matted dirt and food and brush them. Next, examine
them for wounds, thickening of the margins, and other abnormal
conditions.
b. The ear canals should be examined daily and all visible wax
removed. This can be done with a piece of cotton dipped in a boric
19
AGO 5344B

acid solution or a solution of equal parts of hydrogen peroxide and
water and applied to the Visible parts of the ear canal in the inside
flap of the ear. Wax should be removed in a gentle manner and the
swab must not be forced into the ear canal. As many swabs should
be used as are necessary to thoroughly cleanse the ears. After re-
moving the wax, examine the ear canals for excessive hair growth.
Excessive hair.growth may become matted and cause the dog con-
siderable discomfort as well as reduce his effectiveness in respond-
ing to oral commands.
c. Symptoms of ear trouble are evidenced when a dog constantly
shakes his head, twitches his eyes, and scratches his ears with his
hind feet. When the symptoms persist, the dog should be taken to
the veterinarian for examination and treatment.
28. Eyes.
When a dog has a mucous discharge from the eyes or foreign ob-
jects or other irregularities are noted in or about the eyes, he should
be examined by a veterinarian. A dog's eyes are often referred to
as the mirror of his body and their appearance often indicates the
beginning of infections.
29. Nails and Pads
The dog's nails and pads are inspected daily. Long nails often
break or grow into the pads, making a dog unfit for service either
temporarily or permanently. Particular attention should be given
to the nail of the first digit on the front legs. If this first digit, or
dew claw, appears on the rear legs, it should be removed surgically
by the veterinary officer. The pads are inspected daily for cuts,
tears, raw spots, and foreign objects lodged in the creases. In
arctic or subarctic climates, the nails should be trimmed periodi-
cally to prevent their tearing. In addition, the hair on the pads
should be trimmed to prevent the pads from icing up, which causes
them to bruise easily.
30. Teeth
Teeth must be inspected daily. They require cleaning when there
is an accumulation of tartar. Normally, tartar is removed by the
veterinarian. Sometimes dogs have abnormal or diseased teeth
that have to be removed.
31. Bathing
a. A normal, healthy dog should be bathed as often as is neces-
sary. His skin is rich in oil glands and deficient in sweat glands.
Oil excreted by the oil glands keeps the skin soft and prevents it
20 AGO 5344B

from becoming dry and cracking. This also protects the coat and
makes the outer coat water-resistant. When a dog is bathed too
frequently, the natural oil is removed from the skin and the skin
and coat become unnaturally dry, resulting in a poor coat and
minute cracks in the skin. These cracks cause an irritation which
makes the dog scratch and bite himself, thus preparing the way
for eczema or infectious skin ailments.
b. Before bathing a dog, put a wad of cotton in each ear. Take
care not to let soapy water get in the dog's eyes. The temperature
of the bath water should be no more than 5° higher than the room
or area where the dog is bathed. Any good soap which does not
contain too much free alkali may be used, provided care is taken
to rinse away all traces of the soap before the dog is removed from
the bath. When soap is left in the coat, it becomes sticky, collects
dirt, and causes skin irritation. After the bath, dry the dog with
towels as thoroughly as possible, then massage him by hand and
brush his coat. Finally, as an aid to drying, he may be encouraged
to run outdoors for a while, preferably when the sun is shining,
never when the weather is very cold.
32. Skin Parasites
a. See paragraph 51.
b. Daily grooming helps to keep the dog free from skin para-
sites, but more drastic measures may be needed, such as dipping,
spraying, or the use of insect powder as prescribed by the veteri-
narian.
33. Evacuation of Intestines and Bladder
A dog must be allowed to empty both his bladder and intestines
at regular intervals. One of these periods must be shortly before
the training period to prevent him from interrupting the training
procedure and to avoid fouling the training field. If a dog needs to
evacuate during the training period, and is not allowed to do so,
he is usually unable to give his best training performance. It
should be borne in mind that a mature dog cannot empty his
bladder thoroughly except by frequent evacuations. He must be
allowed time to perform this function thoroughly. Urine is dis-
charged from the bladder at frequent, short intervals until pres-
sure is entirely relieved.
34. Anal Glands
The anal glands are small glands situated on either side of the
dog's anus or rectum. They often become impacted with their
secretion, and sometimes they become infected. Both conditions
AGO 5344B 21

cause annoyance and pain. The secretion in these glands should be
expressed, when necessary, by placing a large piece of cotton over
the anus and pressing firmly with the thumb and forefingers
on both sides of the rectum, expelling the impacted matter into the
cotton. Infected glands require immediate treatment by the
veterinarian.
Section V. FEEDING
35. Food Requirements
a. To a great extent, a dog is able to digest the same foods as
man. As far as anyone knows, the dog has the same nutritional
requirements as man. The dog in the wild state does a very good
job of balancing his diet. When he kills a rabbit he devours it en-
tirely; he may eat even the head and fur. A dog can, however, be
maintained in just as good a physical condition on a diet balanced
artificially. Proteins contained in the muscles of the rabbit are
also to be found in other meat, milk products, and certain plant
products. In place of the plant products found in the stomach of
the rabbit, the balanced feed provides carbohydrates through corn,
and other plant products. Vitamins contained in animal carcasses
may also be provided through the use of suitable artificial concen-
trates. Foods may be classified according to what they will supply
to the animal's system. In general they are grouped as follows:
(1) Proteins-Flesh makers and tissue builders; mostly sup-
plied to dogs in meat.
(2) Fats-Energy and heat producers; supplied in meat fats.
(3) Carbohydrates-Energy producers; supplied in bread and
cereals.
(4) Minerals-Bone builders; supplied in cereals, vegetables,
and bones.
(5) Vitamins-Essential in the dog's diet. (A normal dog
does not need supplemental vitamin feeding; ordinarily,
the foods named in (1) through (4) above contain the
necessary vitamins.)
b. For authority to requisition military dog rations, see AR
725-8710-2.
36. Meat and Other Sources of Protein
a. Meat is considered the essential part of a normal dog's diet.
Most meat or meat products can be used, but beef, mutton, lamb,
and horse are preferred. Horse meat is an excellent food for dogs
provided that it is not too lean, or that an amount of fat is added.
22 AGO 5344B

Meat may be fed raw, boiled, roasted, or broiled, but should not
be fried. It may be fed in medium size pieces or ground.
b. Other sources of protein are eggs, which should be fed cooked;
milk, dried or raw; cheese; and fish. Fish, fresh, frozen, or canned
makes a satisfactory substitute for meat. Since the protein content
of fish, milk, and cheese is usually somewhat lower than in meat,
it is necessary to feed larger quantities of these foods to obtain the
same protein balance. Meat or other sources of protein must be
regularly included in the dog's ration, and should constitute at least
one-third of the total to insure satisfactory growth of young dogs
and repair of tissue in mature animals.
c. Plant proteins, particularly legumes, are also valuable in a
dog's diet.
37. Water
Clean fresh water should be supplied for drinking, although
usually a dog is not particular about the source of his water supply
and will drink anywhere if he is thirsty. The handler may note
that a dog will eat the meal provided and immediately go to the
water bowl. Usually he will drink a few laps and go away. Occa-
sionally, a dog will drink excessive quantities of water, which
causes him to vomit. In such cases, it may be necessary to ration
the water in small quantities at frequent intervals. If the vomiting
condition persists, it should be brought to the attention of the
veterinarian.
38. Cereals and Cereal Products
Cereal grains and certain cereal products are not greatly relished
by dogs. Such foods should be given, however, since they supply
bulk, energy, protein, some vitamins, and minerals. Cereals may
constitute a third of the total feed for mature dogs. The cereal
grains most commonly used for dog feeding are corn, rice, oats,
wheat, and barley.
a. Corn is used chiefly as meal to make cornbread, a feed that is
most suitable as a cold weather ration and for dogs that get quite
a bit of exercise. Cornbread is rich in carbohydrates.
b. Rice is considered a suitable dog feed. It must be cooked
thoroughly and should be slightly seasoned with salt to make it
palatable. Unpolished rice is superior to the common polished type
both in vitamin and mineral content.
c. Oats are sometimes of value if they are ground or rolled. This
food must be cooked thoroughly. Like cornbread, it is best for
active, outdoor dogs, and as a cold weather ration.
23
AGO 5344B

d. Except in commercially prepared canned foods, wheat is
seldom used as a cooked grain for dog feeding, but various products
made from wheat often find their way into the canine ration. Chief
of these are bread, some dry prepared breakfast foods, dog meals,
and dog biscuits.
(1) Bread is useful in a variety of forms. Dried or toasted
bread that is not needed for human use makes a good
cereal food for dogs when given in combination with meat
broths, soup, or milk. When fed in this way, only enough
liquid should be added to moisten the bread. Moldy bread
must never be fed to dogs.
(2) When prepared breakfast foods made from wheat or
other cereal grain are fed, they are usually moistened
with milk, broth, or water. Such foods are suitable for a
light morning meal.
(3) Dog biscuits of various kinds are also generally suitable
for supplying the cereal portion of the ration. They may
be fed dry, moistened, or mixed with cooked meat and
vegetables. These biscuits can be obtained in many sizes
and shapes (square, oval, bone-shaped, cubes, pellets, or
kibbled-broken into small pieces), and their composition
varies, depending on the specific use for which they are
intended. Practically all of them are high in cereal and
low in moisture content, and they contain various combi-
nations of meat byproducts.
(4) Commercially made dog meals are usually similar to dog
biscuits in composition, but are ordinarily not so well
adapted to a variety of uses. They are generally fed
mixed with water or milk.
e. Barley is not very palatable to a dog, but is used in the cooked
form in some commercial mixtures.
39. Bones
a. Although bones are not absolutely necessary to keep a dog in
top physical shape they are useful in helping keep the animal's
teeth clean. An occasional bone may be given to a dog provided it
is a knuckle joint. Bones which shatter, such as chicken bones,
must never be fed to a military dog. If bones are small or brittle
enough to shatter, pieces or splinters may scrape, cut, and even
perforate the stomach or intestines. If they pass safely to the
rectum, small particles may pack together and cause clogging or
inflammation there.
b. It is a good practice to give a dog a knuckle joint once a week
24 AGO 5344B

and let him keep it for a limited time (about 4 hours). Dogs must
be separated when given bones to prevent fighting.
40. Vegetables
The primary function of vegetables in the dog ration is to fur-
nish vitamins and minerals, supply bulk, act as fillers, and regulate
the bowels. Of the common vegetables, canned or raw tomatoes are
suitable because they can be mashed easily and mixed with various
other foods. The extensive use of vegetables which have a high
fiber content should be avoided. The normal cereal ration for a
military dog has the necessary amount of vegetables included.
41. General Feeding Rules
The following rules should be generally observed:
a. Average Ration. The normal daily ration for a scout or sentry
dog in training or when performing full duty should be four
pounds. This ration is broken down into one-third horsemeat, one-
third cereal or biscuit, and one-third water. After mixing, the food
should be allowed to stand for about 30 minutes before being fed
to the dog. This allows the cereal time to absorb the liquid used.
A dog may be put on one-quarter, one-half, or three-quarter ration,
depending on his size and whether he is overweight, and on the
amount of work he performs.
b. Number of Meals. Ordinarily, one meal a day is enough for
a mature dog. To bring an underweight dog to proper working
condition, he may be fed a supplemental ration of milk, eggs,
cereal, or additional normal rations in excess of four pounds per
day.
c. Time of Feeding. The time of feeding depends on whether the
dog is to work on the night or day shift. He must never be fed his
ration just before he goes to work and never immediately after
strenuous exercise. A dog works best when his stomach is empty.
A full stomach makes him sluggish. The same principle is applied
for feeding during training.
d. Dryness of Food. As a general rule, it is desirable to feed
dogs a slightly dry diet. The mixed food should be crumbly moist.
Sloppy food is difficult to digest because the excessive moisture in
the food dilutes the dog's gastric juices and retards chemical action
on the food. Sometimes, a dog will regurgitate food that is sloppy.
AGO 5344B 25

Section VI. PREVENTION OF DISEASE AND FIRST AID
FOR INJURIES
42. General
The treatment of dog diseases and injuries and the prevention of
diseases are functions of the Veterinary Corps. Many diseases and
injuries are preventable if all who are concerned with the dogs are
vigilant, intelligent, and untiring in the application of simple pre-
ventive measures. Frequently, the development of serious diseases
or injuries can be prevented by prompt first aid measures and early
treatment.
43. Healthy Dog
Health is the condition of the body in which all bodily functions
are performed in a normal manner. It is particularly essential
that the normal functions of the body of the animal be thoroughly
understood, otherwise one cannot hope to recognize abnormalities.
a. Appearance. In the standing position, a dog's four feet are
placed squarely on the ground or one hind foot may be placed
slightly in advance of the other. The head is held alert, the eyes
are wide open, the nose is moist and free from discharge, and the
ears are erect (fig. 7). The coat has a lustre and the skin is supple
and easily moved about over the structure underneath. The color
of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nostrils, and mouth is salmon
pink.
b. Natural Functions. The bowels are evacuated on an average
of three to 4 times in the course of 24 hours and the stool should
be formed and free from mucous. The color of the stool will vary
according to what the dog eats. The urine is voided at frequent
intervals. Its color varies from light to dark yellow, depending on
the dog's diet.
c. Temperature. The normal body temperature of the dog at rest
is 101° F., but may vary 1° in either direction. Immediately after
work, and especially under a hot sun, the temperature of healthy
animals may rise, but as a rule it is unaffected by climatic condi-
tions and it is thus a most valuable guide to a dog's general state of
health. The temperature is taken with a clinical thermometer in
the xectum. The thermometer is moistened or oiled and the mercury
is shaken down to 96° F. or lower. The bulb of the thermometer
is inserted in the anus and allowed to remain for 3 minutes. When
it is withdrawn, the temperature is read, the thermometer
washed in cold water, and the mercury shaken down again below
normal. A rise in temperature often precedes any visible symp-
26
AGO 6344B

toms in contagious diseases and is important in confirming a sus-
pected infection.
d. Breathing. A dog's breathing may be most conveniently noted
by the rise and fall of his flanks. The number of respiratory move-
ments while he is at rest will normally vary from 8 to 16 per
minute in moderate weather. These should not be counted when
the animal is first approached, as excitement or movement causes
an increase in the number of respirations. Immediately following
exercise, the respiration rate may increase to 60 to 90 per minute.
During warm weather, while the dog is at rest, respiration is
greatly accelerated due to the fact that the skin glands are not
active enough to assist in the respiratory functions. To make up
for this lack, the dog breathes through his mouth and increases
the frequency of respiration.
e. Pulse. The normal pulse rate is from 70 to 100 beats per
minute. The pulse may be felt on the left side just in back of the
elbow joint, or by placing the fingertips lightly on the femoral
artery which is located on the inside of each hind leg. The beats
should be counted for 30 seconds and multiplied by two. The animal
should be at perfect rest when the pulse is taken, as exercise and
excitement quickens it. In illness, the pulse is usually faster than
normal and may be stronger or weaker.
Figure 7. An alert healthy dog.
AGO 5344B 27

f. Mucous Membranes of the Eyes, Nose, and Mouth. Normally,
the mucous membranes are a salmon pink color and free from con-
gested areas and discharges. During illness, they may become red,
pale or white, or yellow.
g. Skin. In health, the skin should be supple and roll easily on
the underlying structure. The hair should have a lustre, feel soft,
and lie evenly. In disease, the skin is dry as if adhering to the
muscles below; the coat is dull in appearance, harsh to the touch,
with the hair on end instead of lying flat.
44. Indications of Disease
Every disease has different indications and the symptoms vary
so greatly that only exhaustive study can acquaint one with their
many indications. The most common preliminary indications of
disease are partial or complete loss of appetite, rise in temperature,
accelerated breathing, increased pulse rate, listlessness, dejected
appearance, nasal discharge, persistent cough, diarrhea, constipa-
tion, unhealthy coat of hair, and swelling in any part of the body.
One of the first and most important symptoms of sickness is loss
of appetite. The best time to inspect dogs for evidence of sickness
or injury is while they are being fed or groomed.
45. Classes of Diseases
a. Communicable Diseases.
(1) Definition. Communicable diseases are diseases that are
transmitted from animal to animal either by direct con-
tact between sick and well, or indirectly through the
medium of infected kennels, unsanitary feeding dishes,
flies, lice, ticks, mosquitoes, and faulty sanitation. A dis-
eased animal throws off in the discharges from the res-
piratory, digestive, and urinary systems the material
which transmits the disease to other susceptible animals.
Some of these diseases are incurable, some may be trans-
mitted to man, and all may cause great harm if not held
in check. Communicable diseases are always marked by
a period of incubation, which is the time interval that
elapses between infection and the appearance of the
symptoms of the disease. This period may vary from a
few days to several weeks. Examples of contagious dis-
eases are distemper, rabies, mange, and ringworm.
(2) Predisposing causes. Conditions that lower general vital-
ity and natural resistance to disease, thereby making dogs
more susceptible to infection, are termed predisposing
causes. The principal causes are exposure, improper
28 AGO 5344B

grooming, lack of sufficient food, overwork, and other
diseases.
(3) Prevention. The logical way to prevent the entrance of
communicable disease is to correct the faulty conditions
that predispose the animal. When a disease once gains
entrance to a group of dogs, there are certain rules of
procedure that have been found necessary to check its
spread to healthy animals and to stamp it out. These
measures are-
(a) Daily inspection of all animals to detect new cases.
(b) Quarantine of exposed animals.
(c) Isolation of sick animals.
(d) Disinfection of infected kennels and the surrounding
area, equipment, and utensils.
(4) Quarantine.
(a) Quarantine is the separation of the apparently healthy
dogs that have been exposed to the infection from those
that are healthy and have not been exposed.
(b) Animals that have been exposed or are suspected to
have been exposed to a communicable disease are poten-
tial sources of infection and they may be in the incuba-
tive stage of the disease. In many diseases, a dog may
be infected during the incubation period or in the very
early stages of the disease before the characteristic
symptoms are noticeable. For this reason, such animals
should be placed in quarantine to protect the unexposed
animals.
(c) The incubation period for most of the ordinary com-
municable diseases of dogs is less than 3 weeks. It is
obvious that the period of quarantine should be longer
than the period of incubation.
(d) The quarantine of exposed animals during an outbreak
of disease is mandatory. It is prescribed in AR 40-905.
A quarantine period of not less than 21 days has been
adopted by the Army. The discovery of a new case in
the quarantine group is cause for beginning a new
period of quarantine. Provisions for the quarantine of
newly arrived animals at a station are also in AR
40-905.
(e) The place selected for quarantine should be located so
that it is impossible for other dogs to enter or come in
contact with the quarantined dogs.
(f) The severity of quarantine rules depends upon the
AGO 5344B 29

nature of the disease. Attendants in the quarantine
area should not handle other dogs, and strict sanitation
is mandatory at all times.
(5) Isolation. Isolation is the absolute segregation from all
other animals of an animal with a communicable disease,
or one suspected of being infected. It must be complete
in every detail to be of any value.
(6) Disinfection. The application of agents called disinfec-
tants, used for the purpose of destroying disease-produc-
ing organisms, is called disinfection. It is essential to
thoroughly clean kennels and equipment before disinfect-
ing them. It is a waste of time to disinfect a kennel, uten-
sil, or anything used by a dog unless it has previously
been thoroughly cleaned. Fresh air and sunlight are
potent disinfectants. Therefore, a kennel with plenty of
windows and ventilation is more sanitary than one that
is dark and damp.
b. Noncommunicable Diseases. Noncommunicable diseases in-
clude all diseases that are not transmissible either directly or in-
directly from one animal to another. Many of these diseases are
directly caused by improper methods of animal management. While
noncommunicable diseases are the cause of many lost days of
animal service, they do not present the serious problems encoun-
tered in communicable diseases. Examples of noncommunicable
diseases are tumors, epilepsy, and nutritional disturbances.
46. Nursing
a. Good nursing is indispensable in the treatment of sick and
injured dogs. The chief points to consider in nursing are-
(1) Ventilation. Allow plenty of fresh air, but protect the
dog from drafts. Avoid exposure to extreme tempera-
tures and, in the field, provide shelter from wind and rain.
(2) Bedding. A good, clean, bed induces an ailing dog to rest.
It should be changed several times a day and all food
particles and fecal matter should be removed.
b. Convalescent animals should receive as much exercise as their
individual cases permit. It must be borne in mind, however, that
rest is one of the best treatments.
c. Dogs that are weak or depressed should not be too thoroughly
groomed. They should be carefully brushed once a day and the eyes
and nostrils wiped out with a moist piece of cotton. Animals that
are only slightly sick should be completely groomed every day.
d. Some sick dogs retain a good appetite, but such patients
30
AGO 6344B

should not be overfed. Their stools should be kept soft, and they
should have plenty of fresh water. Sick animals with impaired
appetites require special attention and often relish a change in diet.
They should be fed often and in small amounts. Uneaten portions
should not be allowed to remain with the dog in the kennel. The
feeding dishes should be kept clean. To induce eating, hand feed-
ing or forced feeding of liquid foods may be used as a last resort.
47. Wounds and Injuries
a. Wounds. A break in the skin, body tissues, or lining of a
body cavity, resulting from external violence or muscular activity
of the body itself, is known as a wound. For the purpose of descrip-
tion, wounds are classified as incised wounds or cuts, lacerated
wounds or tears, punctured wounds or holes, and abrasions.
(1) Incised wounds or cuts are caused by sharp objects. Al-
though this type of wound bleeds freely due to the cut
blood vessels, there is very little tissue destruction and
infection does not often follow if proper care and treat-
ment is given.
(2) Lacerated wounds or tears involve a destruction of tissue,
and create a likely seat of infection. Bleeding is not as
severe as in incised wounds.
(3) Punctured wounds or holes may be caused by any object
that will penetrate the tissues. Nails, sharp pieces of
wood, and bullets are some of the common causes. Wounds
of this type are difficult to clean and favor infection due
to extensive tissue destruction and foreign material which
is carried into the deeper tissues. Hemorrhage in this
type of wound is of little concern unless a large blood
vessel is severed.
(4) Abrasions are wounds caused by the rubbing of the skin
against some object which produces an area of irritation.
Rope burns are an example.
b. First Aid Treatment of Wounds. Before attempting to ad-
minister first aid, secure the dog's mouth with a muzzle.
(1) Bleeding must be controlled before any attempt is made to
clean or bandage a wound. Normally, it can be controlled
by applying pressure directly to the bleeding surface.
To do this, make a compress (a folded cloth or pad) with
a clean piece of gauze or handkerchief, place it over the
wound, and bind it firmly in position with a bandage.
Have a veterinary officer examine the dog and give fur-
ther treatment.
31
AGO 5344B

(2) If a veterinary officer is not available, the handler may
give the following emergency treatment. After bleeding
has been controlled, clean the wound. First, clip the sur-
rounding hair with scissors and wash the dirt from the
injured parts with clean water. All visible foreign mate-
rial should be removed from the wound but the wound
should not be packed, probed, or covered with ointment.
The wound may be covered first with gauze, then cotton.
This dressing is secured with a bandage. Never place
cotton directly over a wound, and never apply a bandage
over a tourniquet. When first aid measures have been
administered, carry the dog to the veterinarian for fur-
ther examination and treatment.
c. Injuries. Bruises, strains, sprains, and fractures are classified
as injuries. They are caused by external violence or from muscular
activity of the body itself, and involve muscles, tendons, ligaments,
joints, organs, and bones. A break in the skin need not accompany
an injury.
d. FirstA id Treatment of Injuries.
(1) Bruises and sprains. The application of hot or cold packs
to bruises, sprains, and strains will prove beneficial. Com-
plete rest is essential.
(2) Fractures. Most fractures occur in the extremities of the
body. The causes are varied, but the greater number of
cases result from falls, kicks, bites from other animals,
and gunshot wounds. Before attempting to administer
first aid, secure the dog's mouth with a muzzle. Assuming
that the dog has a leg injury, place him in a reclining
position and carefully examine the leg to determine the
extent of the injury. If the leg is obviously fractured
(broken), or a fracture is suspected, make splints from
two flat pieces of wood wide enough and long enough to
accommodate the length and shape of the leg. Place one
splint on the inside and the other on the outside of the
leg and bind both in position with strips of gauze bandage.
The dog should then be carried to the veterinarian. When
the fracture cannot be splinted, place the dog on a firm,
improvised litter made from boards and carry him to the
veterinarian.
(3) Eye injury.
(a) Injuries to the eye are very common. They occur as
wounds and lacerations, and result from contact with
foreign objects or from external violence such as bites
32 AGO 5844B

received in dogfights. If at all possible, only a veteri-
nary officer should treat eye injuries.
(b) If a veterinary officer is not available, the handler may
give the following emergency treatment. Bathe the in-
jured eye with clear warm water and then examine it
for the presence of foreign material. Carefully remove
the foreign material if you can do so without causing
further injury. Then place a moist piece of gauze over
the eye and top it with a cotton pad. The gauze and pad
should be held in place with a loose bandage.
(4) Burns.
(a) Burns may be caused by hot liquids, chemicals, fire, and
friction. The extent of the damage to the body tissues
is defined by the appearance of the injured parts. In
first degree burns, the skin is reddened. Blistering
occurs with second degree burns. When deeper destruc-
tion occurs, the tissue takes on a cooked appearance
and the condition is referred to as a third degree burn.
(b) All burns should be treated immediately by a veteri-
nary officer. Care should be taken to avoid contamina-
tion of the injured surface.
48. Bandages
a. Uses. Bandages are one of the oldest forms of surgical appa-
ratus and are employed-under varying conditions for many pur-
poses. The chief uses for bandages are to--
(1) Control bleeding by pressure.
(2) Hold dressings and compresses in place.
(3) Hold splints in place.
(4) Immobilize a part of the body.
b. Application.
(1) The roller bandage is the type most frequently used for
applying dressings, splints, compresses, and pressure. To
apply it, use one hand to hold and direct the roll, the other
to keep each lap smooth and to hold the turn while taking
up slack or changing directions. Apply the bandage to
the injured part snugly enough to exert the desired
amount of pressure and to prevent slipping, but be care-
ful not to shut off circulation by too much pressure.
When the ends of the bandage are secured they should
be tied only as tight as the bandage has been applied.
(2) A bandage should be applied over gauze and cotton and
not directly to the body. It is not advisable to apply a wet
33
AGO 5344B

gauze bandage, for it may tighten as it dries and cause
undue pressure, Bruised areas usually become swollen
within a short time following injury. This should be
borne in mind when bandaging is contemplated, as the
application of a snug bandage to the original wound will
impair circulation if swelling occurs.
(3) In applying a bandage to an injured leg, it is advisable to
bandage the foot as well, even when the foot is not in-
jured. This prevents swelling below the wound and makes
the bandage more secure. In securing the ends of the
bandage, fasten them on the outside of the leg but not
directly over the injured area, as pressure from the knot
on the wound will cause the animal discomfort.
(4) When a dog's body needs to be bandaged, a split-tailed
bandage may be used. This is made from a piece of cloth
long enough to completely encircle the body and provide
strips for ties. The material is folded in half and strips
are cut into the material at the open ends. A dressing is
placed on the chest, flank, or abdomen, as required, the
bandage is placed around the body, and the strips tied on
top of'the back. Made on a smaller scale, a split-tailed
bandage may be applied to the head or neck.
49. Disturbances of the Digestive System
a. ForeignB odies in the Mouth. When a dog claws at his mouth,
has difficulty in eating, or has an excessive flow of saliva, the pres-
ence of a foreign object in his mouth should be suspected. Pieces
of bone, splinters of wood, and small stones will lodge between the
teeth and cause the dog distress. Caution must be exercised in
handling a dog that shows these symptoms as similar symptoms
are noted in dogs having rabies. Cases of this kind should be
diagnosed by the veterinarian.
b. Disturbance of the Digestive Tract. Digestive disturbances
are characterized by loss of appetite, persistent vomiting, diarrhea,
stools streaked with blood or covered with mucous, and constipa-
tion. These symptoms may be due to faulty diet, eating of poison-
ous substances, infections, foreign bodies in the intestines, or
parasitic infection.
(1) When there is persistent vomiting and diarrhea, food
should be withheld and the quantity of drinking water
limited. Purgatives should not be administered until the
cause of the illness has been determined.
(2) Constipation is usually the result of heavy feeding, in-
sufficient exercise, and the use of bones and dry biscuits
34 AGO 6344B

in the diet. Constipated animals should be taken to the
veterinarian for treatment.
(3) When it is known or suspected that a dog has eaten some
poisonous substance, vomiting should be induced immedi-
ately. Make the dog vomit by administering large quan-
tities of soapy water, salt water, or dishwater. When the
dog has vomited freely, administer a tablespoonful of
Epsom salts diluted with. water. If a poison such as
bichloride of mercury has been eaten, follow the above
treatment and then administer large quantities of milk.
Keep the dog warm until further treatment can be given
by a veterinarian.
(4) Intestinal parasites will cause digestive disturbances.
Those commonly found in the digestive tract of a dog are
roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, and whipworms.
Occasionally, the presence of parasites may be detected
by a visual examination of a dog's stool. Frequently, tape-
worm segments will be noticed adhering to the hair
around the anus. A microscopic examination of the feces
by the veterinarian will reveal the presence of parasitic
ova. The veterinarian will prescribe specific treatment.
50. Disturbance of Nervous System
In case of any disturbance of a' dog's nervous system, such as
hysteria, convulsions, or general nervous disturbances, do not
attempt to apply restraint or administer treatment. If the dog is
on a leash, tie him to a stake in a shaded area or place him in a
kennel and allow the condition to subside. Summon a veterinarian
or, if the dog's condition returns to normal, carry him to the
veterinary hospital for observation.
51. External Parasites
Fleas, lice, and ticks are parasites which are found on the body
of the dog.
a. Fleas. Fleas reside in unsanitary surroundings. They attach
themselves to dogs and receive nourishment by sucking blood.
They cause the dog considerable annoyance and, in large numbers,
may produce chronic skin eruptions. They also cause the dog to
inflict self-injury by persistent scratching. Fleas on the dog can be
destroyed by applying flea powder or by bathing the dog in a 1 to
2 percent solution of creolin.
b. Lice. Dogs are subject to infestation by two varieties of lice
(biting and sucking). All dogs in the kennel should be examined
AGO 56344B 35

during the daily grooming for evidence of lice infestation. A dog
infested with lice should be isolated and treated with a parasiticide
prescribed by a veterinary officer.
c. Ticks. The common dog tick is a blood-sucking parasite which
attaches itself to the dog by burying its head in the dog's skin. The
female tick is gray and the male is brown. Frequently, they will
be found-attached to one another or feeding on the same area. To
remove ticks easily, moisten a piece of cotton with ether and place
it over the tick. Grasp the tick with the thumb and finger over the
cotton and pull the tick gently but firmly away from the dog's body.
Jerking the tick away leaves the tick's head imbedded in the tissue,
which produces further irritation. The area from which the tick

AGO 6i44B

is removed should be washed and an antiseptic applied. Ticks are
placed in a receptacle as they are removed and are destroyed by
burning. Ticks are carriers of disease transmissible to man and
care should be exercised in handling them.
52. Reporting of Dog Bites
Rabies is transmitted to animals and man through the bite of a
rabid animal. Due to the prevalence of rabies in certain communi-
ties, it is important that all cases of dog bites be reported immedi-
ately. Dogs bitten by wild animals or other dogs should be placed
in the custody of the veterinarian and quarantined as prescribed
in AR 40-905. Military dogs that bite humans are placed under
observation for fourteen days.
53. Restraint of Dogs
a. Before examining or administering first aid to an injured
dog it is always advisable to muzzle him, no matter how well the
handler is acquainted with the dog's normal behavior. An injured
or frightened dog will often bite as a mistaken act of self-defense.
b. A hasty muzzle may be fashioned from a piece,of gauze band-
age, a strong strip of cloth, or a leash. It is placed around the
mouth and looped under the lower jaw. The ends of the leash
(bandage) are pulled taut to tighten the loop and then passed to
the back of the neck just below the ears, where they are securely
held or tied (fig. 8). The muzzle shown in figure 9(1) may also
be used.

CHAPTER 3
BASIC TRAINING
Section I. PRINCIPLES OF DOG TRAINING
54. General
There are no tricks or mystery to dog training. It is a fairly
simple process if based on-
a. A practical knowledge of how a dog's mind works.
b. Constant repetition of training exercises.
c. Suitable recognition of a dog's progress.
d. Patience.
55. General Principles
The effectiveness of a dog training program depends on the re-
gard shown for certain basic principles.
a. The handler must establish himself as the master of the dog
or dogs assigned to him. He pets, praises, feeds, and handles only
the dogs assigned to him. He does not permit anyone else to make
friends with them.
b. The handler must understand the limitations of a dog's mind.
There are many things one cannot expect of a dog and many things
one can, provided he is properly handled. In the beginning, a dog
may be uncertain of what is expected of him. He may not fully
understand a command until he has been made to carry it out
numerous times.
c. There are specific techniques for giving commands so that
they are suggestive or meaningful to 'a dog.
(1) Vocal commands are given firmly and clearly. The tone
and sound of the voice, not volume, are the qualities that
influence the dog. Commands must be directed at the one
dog concerned and not voiced in just any haphazard direc-
tion. They must inspire obedience.
(2) Next to the voice, gestures are the chief means of influ-
encing dogs. Often, vocal commands and gestures are
combined. At first, gestures, may be exaggerated to help
38 AGO 6344B

convey the desired command to the dog. As training pro-
gresses, the exaggeration is reduced.
d. It is essential to make the dog carry out the same command
over and over until he learns to respond to it without hesitating.
Repetition is even more important in dog training than it is in
human learning. However, both handler and dog can go stale or
lose efficiency by practicing any one command too much during one
period. In this case, it is better to go on to another exercise or let
some time elapse, then return to the practice of the command.
e. The handler must never lose patience or become irritated. If
he does, the dog will become hard to handle because he takes his cue
from the handler's attitude. Patience is one of the prime requisites
of a good dog handler, but it must be coupled with firmness. The
moment the dog understands, the handler must demand that he
obey if the dog is to be a prompt and accurate worker.
f. From the very beginning of training, the dog should never be
permitted to ignore a command or fail to carry it out completely.
He must learn to associate the handler's command with his execu-
tion of it. He should never be allowed to suspect that there is any-
thing for him to do BUT obey. He must learn that he will have
to do what the handler commands, that he will have to carry out
the command completely, no matter how long it takes. Laxity on
the part of the handler on even one occasion may result in an atti-
tude or mood of disobedience that means difficulty and delay in the
continuation of the training program. When the handler is sure
that a dog knows what is expected of him and is being willfully
stubborn, the handler may punish the dog by jerking sharply on
the leash.
g. The purpose of punishment is improvement, not reprisal.
(1) A dog does not understand abstract principles of right
and wrong according to human standards, so reward and
punishment must be used to teach him what he must and
must not do.
(2) It is seldom necessary to resort to physical punishment to
teach a lesson to a sensitive dog. Withholding praise,
using a rebuking tone, or even saying "No" reprovingly,
is usually punishment enough for him. If the dog is
callous or insensitive, he must be punished more severely.
The punishment must be made to fit the dog as well as the
misdeed. Timing in punishment is most important. The
correction, whatever form it takes, must always be ad-
ministered immediately after the dog misbehaves. A dog
39
AGO 5344B

cannot connect punishment with a misdeed he committed
several minutes earlier.
(3) Severe punishment should be inflicted as a last resort and
only for deliberate disobedience, stubborness, or defiance
when the dog has learned better. He must never be
punished for clumsiness, slowness in learning, or inability
to understand what is expected of him. Punishment for
such reasons, instead of speeding training, will have the
opposite effect. The word "No" is used to indicate to the
dog that he is doing wrong. "No" is the only word used
as a negative command. It is spoken in a stern and re-
proving tone. If this form of reproof is not successful,
the dog should be chained or kenneled. A handler never
slaps a dog with his hand or strikes him with the leash.
The hand is an instrument of praise and pleasure to the
dog and he must never be allowed to fear it; beating him
with the leash will make him shy of it and lessen the effec-
tiveness of its legitimate use. The dog's name is never
used in connection with a correction.
h. Whenever a dog successfully executes a command, even
though his performance has taken more time than desirable, the
handler always rewards him with a pat on the head and praises
him in some obvious way.
(1) Dogs are usually anxious to please. They must be shown
how to do so. When a dog is rewarded for his perform-
ance he senses that he has done the right thing and will
do it more readily the next time he is given the same
command. Praise may take the following forms:
(a) Kind words.
(b) Patting.
(c) Allowing a few minutes' romp.
(d) Allowing the dog to perform his favorite exercise, in-
cluding free run and play.
(2) It is not advisable to reward a military dog by feeding
him tidbits, as he will become accustomed to this form of
reward and expect it for some act performed in the field
where such food is not available.
(3) Every training period must conclude with petting, praise,
and encouragement for the dog, to keep up his enthusiasm
for his work. If the dog's performance of the particular
exercise does not warrant this, he must be allowed to per-
form a short exercise he knows thoroughly and does well,
so that he will earn the reward legitimately.
40 AGO 5344B

Section II. QUALIFICATION OF HANDLERS
56. Essential Traits
Successful care and training of dogs depends to a great extent
on personal characteristics of the handler. Experience has shown
that the following traits are essential:
a. Friendly Attitude Toward Dogs. Any individual selected to
train and handle dogs must have a genuine fondness for ahid in-
terest in them. If this quality cannot be readily determined in pros-
pective handlers, they should be considered unacceptable.
b. Intelligence. It has been demonstrated that individuals with
less than average intelligence cannot be taught to care for and
train dogs successfully.
c. Patience and Perseverance. The handler cannot force desired
behavior upon dogs nor can he expect dogs to learn as rapidly as
human beings. He must be patient and he must persevere until
each exercise is brought to a successful conclusion.
d. Mental and Physical Coordination. A good handler must be
able to convey his wishes to the dog by body movement and gestures
as well as by voice. This requires a definite amount of mental
and physical coordination.
e. Physical Endurance. Not only must the handler be able to
show good coordination, he must also be able to maintain his efforts
as long as necessary. The handler must be able to "outlast" his
dog during each training period.
f. Resourcefulness. Although training procedure is carefully
set forth, it is inevitable that situations will arise calling for action
not covered by rules. A handler must be able to meet these situa-
tions successfully.
g. Dependability. The welfare of the dog is entirely in the hands
of the handler. Dogs cannot disclose how they are being treated
nor can they make reports. Their physical well-being depends,
primarily, on the willingness of the handler to do such manual labor
as necessary for kennel management, feeding, and dog cleanliness.
Failure in these responsibilities means failure of the training
program.
h. Security Clearance. Since dogs will be guarding sensitive
installations, it is imperative for the handler to have a security
clearance.
57. Determination of Qualifications
There are no purely objective methods of determining how well
41
AGO 6344B

a prospective handler qualifies in the desirable traits. However,
prospective handlers cannot be selected haphazardly. Interviews
provide a satisfactory basis for selection if carefully conducted by
a responsible and duly qualified officer or civilian trainer. Each
candidate should be examined before he is permitted to undergo
any training with military dogs. To insure the effectiveness of this
procedure, each candidate should undergo a second interview after
1 week of training. At this time the candidate should be able to
give a reasonably clear and intelligent account of the instruction
he has received and his attitude toward military dog training
should be carefully checked. If the candidate is rated unsatisfac-
tory upon conclusion of this interview, he should receive no further
training and should be transferred to another organization.
Section III. OUTLINE OF TRAINING PROGRAM
58. Objectives
The objectives of basic training are to-
a. Develop in dogs the behavior that is basic to more specialized
training for specific military functions.
b. Determine the specific military function for which each dog
should be trained.
c. Teach specially selected enlisted men to-
(1) Train dogs.
(2) Train men in the using agencies to which the dogs may
be assigned.
59. Scope
The basic training program involves-
a. Training dogs to carry out the following fundamental com-
mands:
(1) On leash-
(a) Heel.
(b) Sit.
(c) Down.
(d) Stay.
(e) Come.
(f) Crawl.
(g) Jump (Up).
(2) Off leash-
(a) Heel.
(b) Sit.
42 AGO 5344B

(c) Down.
(d) Stay.
(e) Come.
(f) Jump (Up).
b. Accustoming dogs to-
(1) Wearing muzzles and gas masks.
(2) Riding in a vehicle.
(3) Tolerating gunfire.
60. Personnel
Three classes of personnel are involved in the training of dogs.
a. Instructors. Qualified experts designated to take charge of
training men and dogs in either the scouting or sentry field.
b. Assistant Instructors. Qualified individuals designated by
each instructor to assist him in training his classes.
c. Handlers. Men undergoing training in classes conducted by
instructors and assistant instructors. These men simultaneously
train dogs.
61. Equipment
a. The chief equipment (fig. 9) in the training program consists
of the following and is issued for each dog.
(1) A feeding and watering pan.
(2) A russet leather muzzle, used when transporting a dog
and when the veterinarian is treating or operating on a
dog.
(3) A 25-foot leash of cotton webbing, used with obedient
dogs and when a distance between the dog and the handler
is desired.
(4) A 5-foot leather leash, used to control dogs in obedience
training and scouting duties.
(5) A leather leash holder that the handler wears on his belt
to hold the leash when he needs both hands free.
(6) A steel chain, choke-type collar, used for obedience train-
ing and for controlling a dog when moving from one area
to another.
(7) A 1-inch wide leather collar, used as a work collar for
sentry dogs and to tie nonworking sentry and scout dogs.
(8) A zinc coated kennel chain. This is the only piece of
equipment used with the leather collar to tie dogs in the
field.
AGO 5344B 43

(9) A comb.
(10) A grooming brush (horse-grooming brush, M-1912,
black).
(11) A gas mask.
(12) A leather harness, used only with scout dogs when they
work a problem or go on a patrol.
b. The proper use of these items of equipment is of the utmost
importance since it is by these means, combined with voice and
gestures, that the handler communicates his wishes to the dog and
controls and disciplines him.
62. Facilities
Basic training classes should be held within an inclosed area, but
an uninclosed area may be used when necessary.

63. General Procedures
a. As soon as a handler has a dog assigned to him he takes the
dog for a walk on a leash to become acquainted and to help establish
mutual understanding before training begins.
b. Instruction is organized as follows:
(1) The working unit for training is the squad (fig. 10) with
the assistant instructor of each squad in charge.
(2) At the beginning of a training period each assistant in-
structor takes his squad of handlers to the kennels to fetch
the dogs they are to work with for that period.
(3) Under the supervision of the assistant instructor, the
handlers put their dogs on leash and fall in line, with

each dog on the left side of his handler and an interval
of 6 feet between handlers.
(4) From this point, the training proceeds under the direc-
tion of the instructor or assistant instructor, or both.
(5) At the end of the training period, the assistant instructor
leads his squad back to the kennels where another group
of dogs is assembled for the next period.
(6) The length of each training period is determined by the
instructor, based on the weather and willingness of the
dogs. Ordinarily, each dog is given frequent but short
training periods (10-20 minutes each) daily. During hot
weather, a temperature of 90° or over, training periods
are restricted to early morning hours.
(7) Every training period starts with a short exercise in com-
mands the dog has already learned. In this way the dog's
mastery of the basic responses is strengthened. Also,
starting the training period with familiar activities gives
the dog confidence, puts him into a spirit of obedience,
and thus makes it easier for him to learn the new exer-
cises. The review periods can be shortened to about five
minutes as training advances.
64. Corrective Command
The only corrective command used in training is NO, given in a
stern voice. A dog must learn quickly that the command NO indi-
cates his handler's-displeasure.
Section IV. HEEL (ON LEASH)
65. Standard of Performance
At the command HEEL, the dog (of his own accord) walks to
the handler's left side with his right shoulder even with the han-
dler's left knee. The leash hangs loose. The dog must heel correctly
whenever the handler changes his direction of movement, or when
he walks through a group of people, and at the halt (figs. 11
and 12).
66. Training Procedure
a. InitialE xercise in Heeling.
(1) The squad falls in, each dog at his handler's left. The
handler holds the end of the leash in his right hand, and
the leash hangs loosely in front of him. The instructor
or assistant instructor gives the command FORWARD,
AGO 5344B 47

MARCH. Each handler then gives his dog the command
HEEL in a firm voice, jerks slightly on the leash, and
steps off smartly, keeping a 6-foot interval with the han-
dler on his right. The squad walks clockwise around a
prearranged training square several times, changing
direction at the corners without command. During the
walk, each handler repeats the command HEEL to his
dog every two or three steps, and continuously tries to
get the dog to walk easily on a loose leash at his side.
From time to time, he supplements the oral command
with a command gesture which consists of slapping the
side of his thigh with his left hand (fig. 12). If the dog
gets ahead or falls behind, the handler jerks on the leash
and repeats the command HEEL, and slaps his thigh.
The handler never pulls steadily on the leash, and he does
not allow the dog to pull on it. He jerks the leash re-
peatedly, when necessary, allowing it to fall slack immedi-
ately after each jerk. A steady pull causes the dog to
set his muscles against the collar and makes the taut
leash ineffective for training purposes. If the dog pulls

Figure1 2. Command gesture for HEEL.
ahead, causing the leash to become taut, the handler drops
his hand to lessen the tension, then jerks the leash.
(2) This exercise is also practiced walking counterclockwise
around the training square so the dog can learn to make
left turns smoothly at heel. The handler may nudge the
dog's shoulder with his left leg as they start to make a
left turn to help the dog understand the direction he is
to take.
AGO 5344B 49

b. Advanced Exercises in Heeling. To vary the monotony of
practice in heeling, as well as to teach the dogs to stick close to
their handlers, the instructors or his assistant should occasionally
command, left face, right face, and to the rear.
(1) At the command LEFT (RIGHT) FACE, MARCH, each han-
dler makes a quarter turn in the desired direction, giving
the command HEEL at the same time, and slapping his
thigh.
(2) TO THE REAR, MARCH is given as the squad is heeling in
single file around the training square. At the command
MARCH, each handler takes one more step forward and
faces to the rear in marching. As he turns, he gives his
dog the command HEEL and jerks on the leash. He may
jerk the leash once or twice during the turn to help the
dog understand he is to follow around the handler and
come to heel on his left side.
c. Amount of Training. Practice in heeling is continued in peri-
ods of about 15 minutes until perfection is achieved.
Section V. SIT (ON LEASH)
67. Standard of Performance
At the command SIT, which is given when the dog is either
standing, lying, or heeling, the dog must promptly assume a sitting
position.
68. Training Procedure
a. SIT is taught in conjunction with heeling, but not until after
the dog has learned to heel. After several times around the train-
ing square at heel, the instructor or his assistant commands HALT.
As the handler stops, he gives the command SIT. At the same time,
he pushes the dog's hindquarters downward with his left hand and
pulls upward on the leash with his right hand as shown in figure
13. He follows this procedure at each repetition of the command
SIT until the dog understands what is wanted of him and will sit
at the oral command only.
b. If the dog does not sit facing directly forward, but to the left
or right, or facing the handler, the handler swings the dog's body
around with his left hand to get him into the proper position. If
the dog sits behind the handler or too far from his side, he pulls
the dog's head close to his left side by using the leash; with his
left hand, he restrains the dog from getting up and following the
leash. This correction is most effective when carried out as the

dog is in the act of sitting, before his hindquarters have touched
the ground. Each handler must insist on the proper position at
every halt (fig. 14). The instructor or assistant instructor should
allow enough time for the dog to execute SIT and the handler to
correct the position before he gives the order to march again (FOR-
WARD, MARCH). When this command is given, the handler gives
the command HEEL, as before, and moves out. This exercise is
repeated as often as necessary for the dog to learn to sit in re-
sponse to the oral command only.
AGO 5344B 51

Figure 14. Sitting in heel position at the halt.
Section VI. DOWN (ON LEASH)
69. Standard of Performance
At the command DOWN, which is accompanied by a downward
motion of the arm (fig. 15), the dog must lie down promptly. The
dog is expected to make this response to the oral command and the
command gesture given alternately, whether he is standing, sitting,
or heeling (fig. 16).
52 AGO 5344B.

70. Training Procedure
a. Formation. The command DOWN can best be taught with the
handlers lined up in front of their dogs. Each handler gives the
oral command to his own dog, while the instructor or assistant goes
up and down the line to help and make corrections.
b. Procedure.
(1) The handler does not use the command gesture when first
teaching DOWN. Instead, as he commands DOWNI,h e
grips the dog's leash close to the collar and jerks down.
on it. If the dog braces himself and refuses to go down,
the handler pulls his forelegs out with his free hand and
pulls down on the leash, at the same time repeating
DOWN. As soon as the dog is down, the handler praises
and pats him. He then holds the end of the leash in his
hand, stands before his dog, and commands SIT. If the
dog does not sit, the handler pulls upward on the leash,
steps closer to the dog and repeats the command SIT. As
soon as the command has been properly executed, he
praises the dog again.
(2) As soon as the dog learns to assume the DOWN position
without being touched-by the handler, the handler starts
using the command gesture (fig. 15) along with the oral
command.
71. Amount of Training in the Command "DOWN"
This exercise should be repeated four or five times in a period.
It is a depressing exercise and must not be repeated too often in
succession. After the first period, a series of exercises devoted to
this command, as well as HEEL and SIT can be alternated or prac-
ticed concurrently.
Section VII. STAY (ON LEASH)
72. Standard of Performance
At the command STAY, the dog holds the position he is in when
the command is given, while the handler moves away from him.
The dog must remain in this position until the handler returns to
him and gives a different command. The command STAY may be
given while the dog is standing, sitting, or down.
73. Training Procedure
a. Stay (Dog in Down Position).
(1) Practice in staying should be started in the down position
AGO 5344B 53

since this is the easiest one for the dog to maintain. The
5-foot leash is used for teaching STAY. Each handler
gives his dog the command DOWN. When the dog has
obeyed, the handler backs away slowly. As he does so he
watches the dog attentively, uses the gesture shown in
figure 17, and repeats the command STAY, in a stern
voice, drawing out the word to cover his retreat. The
handler reaches the end of the leash, always keeping his
eyes on the dog, and alert for the first sign that the dog
is about to get up or break away. (If there is evidence
that the dog is not going to stay, the handler goes back
to the dog, motions him down, and repeats the command,
STAY, STAY.) If the dog attempts to come to the han-
dler at the command STAY, the handler commands NO-
STAY, and returns the dog to the spot where he first re-
ceived the command STAY. He moves away from the dog
again, then walks back toward him, passes on his left side,
walks behind the dog, turns around, and stands in posi-
tion with the dog lying at his left side. During this move-
ment the handler must repeatedly command STAY, STAY
in a soothing voice. Finally, he gives his dog the com-
mand SIT and, when the dog obeys, praises and pats him.
(2) After this exercise has been successfully completed by all
handlers under the supervision of the instructor (assist-
ant), the squad is ordered to march around the training
square with the dogs at heel, before being lined up for a
repetition of the exercise. Each time this exercise is re-
peated, the instructor (assistant) should keep the dogs
in the stay position a little longer before sending their
handlers back to them.
b. Stay (Dog in Sitting Position). The handler trains his dog
to stay in a sitting position by the procedure described in a above.
He should augment his first command to stay with the command
gesture shown in figure 18. He alternates practice in staying in the
sit and down positions until the dog is able to stay in both positions.
c. Stay (Silent Tie-Up). The handler fastens the dog to a post
or stake with the kennel chain. He then walks away for a short
distance, remaining in sight of the dog. If the dog starts to whine
or bark, the handler reproves him with a sharp NO, comes up to
him and quiets him. When the animal has remained quiet for about
a minute, the handler releases him and rewards him. The length
of time that the dog remains tied is gradually increased. As the
dog adjusts himself, the handler goes out of sight. Later, the leash
is substituted for the chain and the trainer stations himself where

he can watch closely, for if the dog once bites through a leash, he
may become a confirmed "leather cutter."
Section VIII. COME (ON LEASH)
74. Standard of Performance
After the dog has learned to obey the command STAY, the han-
dler teaches him COME. With the dog in a STAY position, the
handler calls his name, immediately adding the command COME
(fig. 19). The dog must promptly come to the heel position and sit.
75. Training Procedure
a. InitialE xercise. The handler commands DOWN-STAY. He
then backs away to the end of the 5-foot leash. After the dog has
obeyed the command and is staying in the down position, the han-
dler calls the dog's name, following it with the command COME.
At the same time, he tugs slightly on the leash to suggest the mean-
ing of the command and gives the command gesture shown in figure
20. He then changes the end of the leash to the right hand and
gives the oral command HEEL. At the same time he steps back-

wards a full step with the left foot, grasps the leash with the left
hand at a point near the middle and guides the dog to the heel posi-
tion. When the dog reaches the heel position the handler recovers
to the position of attention and commands SIT. He then praises
and pats the dog.
b. Advanced Exercises.
(1) The handler uses a 25-foot leash. He proceeds as de-
scribed in a above, gradually backing away from the dog
until he has reached the end of the leash (fig. 21). He
calls the dog, preceding the command COME with the
dog's name, making sure that he holds the dog's attention.
If the dog starts sniffing the ground or turns away to
watch another dog, the handler immediately jerks the
leash and repeats the command COME in a stern voice.
If necessary, he may pull the dog all the way to him.
(2) After a few days, all of the dogs in the squad will be able
to carry out the command without difficulty. The instruc-
tor (assistant) then separates the handlers by 50 or 60

feet and instructs them to proceed, as follows: The dogs
are allowed to wander around at the full length of the
leash, sniffing and smelling as they please. At intervals
of 1 or 2 minutes, each handler calls his dog by name and
commands COME. If the dog does not come promptly, he
tugs on the leash. If necessary, he jerks the leash at in-
tervals and induces the dog to come by voice. As soon as
the dog is within touching distance, his handler pats and
praises him and then allows him to wander away again.
It may be necessary, at first, to encourage the dog to go
58 AGO 5344B

off by playing with him and pushing him. As soon as the
dog starts to wander away, the handler indicates approval
by saying "OK." The dog will come to realize that this is
a signal of release; that it means he is on his own and
can romp and sniff as he chooses. In calling the dog, the
tone of voice should ; be Xa uthoritativIe , butS n~ev~e~r ~cr5oss.
When the dog comes, he should be praised, never punished
-even if he has been pulled by the leash for the entire
distance.
Section IX. CRAWL (ON LEASH)
76. Standard of Performance
At the command 'CRAWL, the dog crawls alongside or toward
his master. This movement may prove valuable if a scout dog
comes under enemy fire or observation.

77. Training Procedure
The leash is held closely by the handler who commands DOWN
and lies down himself. Then he commands CRAWL, and starts
to crawl himself, encouraging the dog to do likewise (fig. 22). He
can use the leash to correct the dog. After the dog has learned to
crawl with the handler, he is taught to crawl alone. The handler
walks alongside the dog as shown in figure 23. If the dog tries to
rise, the handler may push down on his shoulders and, at the same

time, command NO-CRAWL. For the next stage of the exercise,
the handler stands erect, facing the dog at a distance of a few feet,
and commands DOWN, then CRAWL, to get the dog to crawl to
him. At the same time, he uses the command gesture for CRAWL
(fig. 24). When the dog becomes proficient in this exercise, the
distance between dog and handler is gradually increased.
Section X. JUMP (ON LEASH)
78. Standard of Performance
Almost any dog can and will jump or scale a 31/ -foot wall. The
2
objective of this training exercise is to get him to jump on com-
mand, and ahead of the handler (fig. 25). At the command UP,
the dog must immediately jump or scale the wall and then heel or
return to the handler, according to the handler's position. (A dog
jumps a low hurdle or fence, which means that he clears it. He
scales a higher hurdle or wall, which means that he jumps as high
as he can, then scrambles or climbs the rest of the distance in order
to get over.)
79. Training Procedure
a. Initial Exercise.
(1) A dog may be afraid of a hurdle, even though he may have
been taught to jump hedges or other obstacles. Therefore,
it is well to start this training with a hurdle that has
removable boards, removing all the boards except the two
bottom ones so that the hurdle is low enough to walk over.
(2) The instructor (assistant) instructs members of the
squad to heel their dogs around a small square. He directs
one handler at a time, starting with the handler at the
head of the column, to lead his dog over the hurdle. Each
man steps over the hurdle and, as he does so, gives his
dog the command UP. If the dog hesitates or balks, the
handler coaxes and helps his dog over, tugging on the
leash. As the dog gets to the other side, the handler im-
mediately praises him, steps away from the hurdle, and
commands HEEL. This exercise should be repeated as
often as necessary to make every dog in the group comply
with the command. Those dogs that learn more readily
than others are kept in the line with the slow learners
throughout the training period, because it is desirable for
backward dogs to see them go over the hurdle success-
fully.
64 AGO 6344B

b. Advanced Exercises.
(1) When all the dogs have succeeded in clearing the hurdle
at its initial height, it is raised, one board at a time, and
the jumping exercise is repeated. By the time the second
board is inserted into the hurdle, every dog should be so
proficient in the execution of the command UP that it will
not be necessary for the handler to go over the hurdle
with him. Instead, he goes around the right side of the
hurdle with his left hand extended, holding the middle
of the leash to keep it from catching on the hurdle. As
he does so, he gives the command UP. As the dog's neck
clears the hurdle, he releases the left-hand hold on the
leash, but continues to hold the end in his right hand.
(2) Exercises in jumping from a sitting position are also
undertaken, as follows: The hurdle is at moderate height.
The handler walks up to the hurdle with his dog heeling
on the leash. Stopping about two feet in front of the

hurdle, he makes his dog sit, then gives the command UP
(fig. 26). The handler walks around the right side of the
hurdle holding the middle of the leash in his left hand,
which is extended to permit the dog to jump freely. As
the dog lands on the other side, the handler praises him,
commands HEEL, and walks to his place in line. After
every dog has gone over the hurdle, more height may be
added and the exercise repeated.
(3) Jumping, properly taught, is an exercise which raises the
dog's spirits, and can be interspersed with depressing
exercises such as DOWN. Jumping should include a
variety of obstacles such as hedges, ditches, water, and
walls.
80. Excessive Jumping
Practice in jumping should not be overdone in any period. Al-
though dogs enjoy it, it is very tiring. Other exercises may be
practiced as alternates to jumping when the dogs show signs of
fatigue.
66 AGO 5344B

Section XI. OFF-LEASH EXERCISES (GENERAL)
81. Training Procedure
When the instructor (assistant) observes that the dogs in a
squad are working dependably on a loose leash, he starts the han-
dlers in training them off-leash. To begin with, he may select only
the dogs that are doing the best work to form a special class in
off-leash training. Other classes are added until, finally, all dogs
are working off the leash. Dogs that do not perform dependably
are given extra training periods so that the training of the other
dogs will not be delayed. Dogs are muzzled at the beginning of off-
leash training to reduce the likelihood of dogfights.
82. Training Methods
a. Training the dog to work off the leash follows the same pro-
cedure as that described for working on the leash. During all off-
leash work, the handler depends on the tone of his voice and on
command gestures to direct his dog, as well as the affection which
has been established between him and his dog, and the attitude of
obedience learned by the dog. Nevertheless, the handler must be
alert in noticing any hesitancy on the part of the dog to comply
with his commands and must be able to prevent his dog from
breaking or getting out of position. Once a dog has found that he
can break control it will take a long time to make him dependable
off the leash. When a dog disobeys or breaks away, he should be
put on the leash immediately and made to successfully perform
the exercises on the leash until the instructor decides that it is
safe to take him off the leash again.
b. Even after the dogs have advanced to specialized work, each
training period should begin with a few minutes' exercise heeling
off the leash. The ability to perform off the leash correctly and
dependably is fundamental to all specialized training.
Section XII. HEEL (OFF LEASH)
83. Standard of Performance
A dog must be able to follow his handler at heel on straight
walks, alone, and through groups of people, and through right and
left turns and about face, with the handler using only the oral
command and command gesture for HEEL.
67
AGO 53443

Figure 27. Heeling off leash.
84. Training Procedure
The procedure is the same as that described in paragraph 65, ex-
cept that the handler corrects the dog only with the oral command
HEEL and the command gesture for HEEL. See also figure 27.
68 AGO 5844B

Section XIII. SIT (OFF LEASH)
85. Standard of Performance
See paragraph 67.
86. Training Procedure
When the dog has mastered sitting exercises on a loose leash, the
instructor has the handlers remove the leash and begin training
in the command SIT off leash. The dog is trained to sit in the heel
position first, then is practiced in sitting from the standing and
down positions. The command gesture for sit from the standing
and down positions off leash is given with a sharp upward motion
of the arm while each handler is standing in front of and directly
facing his dog (fig. 28). The distance between handler and dog is
gradually increased as the dog becomes more proficient in the
exercises.
Section XIV. DOWN (OFF LEASH)
87. Standard of Performance
See paragraph 69.
88. Training Procedure
With the dog in a stay position at a distance of 50 feet or more,
the handler calls the dog's name, following it with the command
COME. Before the dog reaches him, he gives the commands STAY,
DOWN, STAY or gives the command gestures, or does both. The
dog responds promptly to each successive command, stopping at
once regardless of his gait, dropping promptly to the down posi-
tion, and staying in that position until his handler gives him a new
command. He must learn to respond to both the oral commands
and the gestures used alone.
a. Prerequisite. Group work in this exercise is started only
when all the dogs in the squad perform satisfactorily in the STAY
and COME exercises off the leash.
b. Organization. The handlers and dogs form a line facing the
instructor (assistant), with an interval of about 10 to 15 feet be-
tween handlers. At the direction of the instructor, each handler
faces his dog and proceeds as outlined in c below.
c. Methods.
(1) The handler commands DOWN and STAY, turns and
walks away to a distance of about 25 feet, and turns to

face the dog. He calls the dog's name and adds the com-
mand COME. When the dog is within 10 feet of him, he
gives the commands STAY, DOWN, STAY in a firm
voice, accompanied by the command gestures, giving the
dog time to respond to each command. As he gives the
first STAY, he takes a step or two toward the dog. At
first, he may have to repeat the oral commands and the
gestures several times. He may even have to approach
the dog and make him assume the down position.
(2) With the dog staying in the down position, the handler
calls him by name and commands COME. As soon as the
dog obeys, he commands HEEL, praises him, and walks
him back to the starting point to repeat the exercise.
After the dog has learned to drop instantly on command,
the handler varies the distances between them for suc-
ceeding repetitions of the exercise. As the dog becomes
more and more proficient and dependable in this exercise,
the handler uses gestures and oral commands independ-
ently so that the dog learns to respond to each alone.
(3) This exercise is depressing to the dog's spirit and must
not be repeated too often in succession.
Section XV. STAY (OFF LEASH)
89. Standard of Performance
At the command STAY-DOWN-STAY, STAY-SIT-STAY, or
STAY, which may be given at any gait, the dog must promptly
assume the position called for while the handler continues ahead.
The dog must remain in this position until the handler either re-
turns to him or commands COME.
90. Training Procedure
a. There are two prerequisites to this training-
(1) The dog must be able to heel off-leash.
(2) The dog must respond to the command COME from the
end of the 25-foot leash.
b. The handler must be able to influence obedience in the dog
by his general attitude, by the tone and timbre of his voice, and
by command gestures.
c. The training for the fundamental exercise off-leash follows
the same procedure as for the STAY exercise on-leash (par. 73).
d. The second step is to make the dog stay in position on com-
71
AGO 5344B

mand given during walking exercises. With the entire squad under
the direction of the instructor (assistant), the handlers start walk-
ing their dogs at heel. When signaled to do so, each handler com-
mands STAY, reaches down and places his left hand in front of
the dog's nose to halt him (fig. 18). He repeats the command
STAY, making a backward motion with his left hand, and turns
slightly to watch the dog. When the dog halts, the handler walks
on about 10 feet further, turns around, and faces the dog. After
an interval, he returns to his dog, and commands SIT. This exer-
cise is repeated several times. Periods of heeling are conducted to
break the monotony. As the dog becomes more and more depend-
able, the handler may increase the distance between them after
giving the command STAY.
e. When all the dogs in the group can be made to stay in their
positions while their handlers continue walking, they are ready for
the last stage of the STAY training. This is an exercise to teach
the dogs to remain in a stay position while their handlers are out
of sight. Under the supervision of the instructor (assistant), each
handler commands his dog DOWN, STAY, then walks about 25
yards away to a previously arranged hiding place. The scaling
hurdle makes a good screen for this purpose, because the handler
can look through the cracks between the boards and watch his dog.
If the dog starts to rise or break, his handler should come out from
his hiding place, advance slowly to the dog, speak to him sternly,
and put him back in place. He then returns to hiding. The instruc-
tor (assistant) uses his judgment as to the length of time the han-
dlers are to remain hidden. At the start, he waits only a few sec-
onds before directing the handler back to his dog. As the exercise
is repeated, the time he remains out of the dog's sight is increased
until the dog will stay in either the sit, stand, or down position
indefinitely with his handler out of sight.
Section XVI. COME (OFF LEASH)
91. Standard of Performance
See paragraph 74.
92. Training Procedure
a. The handler follows the procedure described in paragraph
75b(2) with the following differences. He attaches the 25-foot
leash to the dog's collar and lays the leash loosely along the ground
in front of the dog. He does not hold onto the leash when he starts
the exercises. He practices the dog in COME two or three times
72 AGO 5344B

from a distance of a few feet. After the dog has responded
promptly several times, the handler casually and unhurriedly un-
hooks the leash from the dog's collar and lays that end on the
ground. Then he again practices the dog in COME several times,
varying the distance between dog and handler from 5 to 10 feet.
After the dog responds rather consistently at this range, the dis-
tance is gradually increased until the dog will come on command
or gesture from any distance up to 100 yards.
b. If the dog becomes disobedient at any time during the fore-
going exercises, the handler should put him on leash again as a
corrective measure and make him go through several repetitions
of COME.
Section XVII. JUMP (OFF LEASH)
93. Standard of Performance
See pargaraph 78.
94. Training Procedure
When all the dogs in the group have demonstrated ability to take
the full-height hurdle while on the leash, they are ready to be
trained in jumping over or scaling hurdles and other obstacles
while off the leash (fig. 29). The hurdle is heightened gradually.
When the dog is able to get over the hurdle at its full height and
to return to position as commanded, practice may be undertaken
in jumping over or scaling other obstacles. Practice in jumping
exercises should not be overdone in any one period.
Section XVIII. ACCUSTOMING DOG TO MUZZLE AND GAS MASK
95. General
Dogs are trained to wear a muzzle and a gas mask after they
have learned to heel on leash. The equipment should fit the dog
snugly and comfortably. Accustoming the dog to this new equip-
ment depends entirely on patience and practice.
96. Muzzle
After adjusting the muzzle on the dog (fig. 30), the handler
starts heeling him at a fast walk on leash. If the dog tries to reach
up with a front paw and pull off the muzzle, the handler jerks
upward with the leash and keeps on walking, holding the leash
taut. As soon as the dog stops trying to remove the muzzle, the
handler slackens the leash and praises him.
AGO 5344B 73

97. Gas Mask
After the dog becomes accustomed to wearing a muzzle, he is
trained to wear a gas mask (fig. 31). The first time the mask is
used, the dog must not be made to move fast enough to cause him
to pant.

CHAPTER 4
SPECIALIZED TRAINING
Section I. SCREENING FOR SPECIALIZED TRAINING
98. Screening Procedure
The term "screening" refers to the procedure used to classify
dogs for the type of military service for which they seem best
qualified. This classification is based on observation of the physical
and psychological traits manifested by the dogs from the time they
are given the tests on arrival at reception and training centers
(pars. 14-18), throughout the basic training period, and even after
they have begun specialized training. It is imperative to continue
observing the dogs throughout the training program. The poten-
tialities of some dogs and inherent weaknesses of others may come
to light as unexpectedly as in the case of human beings. The dogs
are observed by a classification board consisting of the command-
ing officer and selected instructors. On the basis of physical and
psychological traits manifested, the board may reject a dog at any
time during training. The screening procedure is shown graphi-
cally in figure 32.
99. Selection for Type of Specialized Training
a. The classification board has the responsibility for deciding
which dogs will be trained as scouts and which will be trained for
sentry duty. The selection is based on consideration of the demon-
strated qualities of an individual dog as measured against the
requirements for the two types of duty. Scouting makes more
demands on a dog's intelligence and temperament than sentry duty.
Normally, therefore, the dogs that qualify best in the desirable
traits (par. 102) are selected for scout training; the others are
given sentry training (par. 113).
b. During the course of scout training, a dog may show that he
is not, after all, suitable for scouting. He may be transferred to
sentry training. A dog that shows during specialized training that
he is unsuitable for sentry duty is rejected.
c. The high standards set in a and b above may be tempered
when necessary to match the available supply of dogs with mili-
tary requirements.
AGO 56844B 77

Section II. PRINCIPLES OF SPECIALIZED TRAINING
100. General
Basic dog training, as an end in itself, has no place in the mili-
tary service. It serves simply, but necessarily, to develop in dogs
the behavior that is essential to efficient and effective training for
specific military functions. A dog that successfully completes basic
training is disciplined and prepared to receive instruction in mili-
tary duties. Furthermore, his behavior during basic training, if
properly observed, is an indication of the type of specialized train-
ing for which he is best suited.
101. Statement of Principles
The effectiveness of specialized dog training depends on the re-
gard shown for the following fundamental principles:
a. The Dog Must be Trained for Only One Job. He may learn to
be a good scout or sentry dog, but never both. Because of his
natural limitations, any effort to train him for more than one job
will diminish the contribution he can make.
b. The General Attitude of the Handler is All-Important. A
handler must fully realize the importance of the work that he is
doing. He must understand and appreciate the fact that dogs are
used to conserve manpower, conserve life, and to further the work
of the military service through the use of their peculiar powers.
c. The Importance of the Handler-Dog Relationship Cannot be
Overestimated. The dog and his handler must work as a team.
Therefore, no handler must be forced to train an animal that he
deems unsuitable. For the same reason, if a dog appears unwilling
to serve a certain handler, it may be necessary to assign him to
another. On the other hand, once a team has been established, the
relationship must not be interfered with by anyone. Only the
handler should pet, feed, or otherwise handle his dog.
d. Association of Ideas Facilitates Learning. Where special
equipment is used, the dog must learn to associate this equipment
with his work.
e. The Dog Should be Motivated Not Only by His Handler's
Praise and Petting, But Also by the Goal of Accomplishing a Mis-
sion. The dog can and should be trained to complete a task as an
end in itself, not simply for the sake of reward by his master. In
all his training, therefore, he must be permitted to finish every
exercise successfully, no matter how many errors he makes. The
dog must always "WIN."

Gunfire and Other Distractionst o Develop the Dog's Responsibility
for Given Tasks and to Assure the Accomplishment of His Mission.
g. The Ability of The Dog is Developed by Training During
Daylight. The effects of daylight training will carry over into
actual service at night. Training is difficult to conduct in darkness
because the handler cannot see well enough to observe the dog's
errors and correct them. But the dog can carry over into nikht
performance the effects of good daylight training. The dog and
handler must be proficient in daylight training before any training
at night is attempted.
h. Review of Previous Training Maintains and Raises the Level
of Performance. Handlers must use their best judgment in deter-
mining how often and how many times previously learned exercises
should be repeated.
i. Successful Training of Military Dogs Depends on the Care
Taken for Their Welfare. Unless the dogs are kept in good health,
properly groomed, fed, and kenneled, the effectiveness of the train-
ing program will be diminished.
Section il. THE SCOUT DOG
102. Selection of Scout Dog
a. To be suitable for scout training, dogs should possess the de-
sirable traits in the following degrees. (See also pars. 7-11.):
(1) Intelligence: High.
(2) Willingness: High.
(3) Aggressiveness: Moderate.
(4) Sensitivity: Medium.
(5) Energy: High.
b. The scout dog should be a sharp, hardy animal of medium
size. He must have highly developed scenting powers, acute hear-
ing, and a good ability to detect motion. He must not be overly
excitable or noisy. It is not necessary for him to have great speed.
103. Uses of Scout Dogs
a. The scout dog is trained to detect and give silent warning of
the presence of any: strange individual or group. He will prove
especially useful in warning of ambushes and attempts at infiltra-
tion. The scout dog is worked by one man, the handler, who has
been especially trained in this type of work. The dog works on a
short or long leash, in daylight or darkness, in any kind of weather,
80 AGO 5344B

and in jungle or open country. He is aware of and gives silent
warning of the presence of unfamiliar humans and animals long
before they can be detected by a human. The distance at which he
can give warning depends on a number of factors-wind direction
and velocity; the volume of concentration of human scent; humid-
ity; density or openness of terrain; and the amount of noise or
other confusing factors in the vicinity. The handler's ability in
"reading" his dog is an important factor in their operations to-
gether.
b. When possible, the scout dog platoon leader should know two
or three days in advance the number and type of patrols he is re-
quired to support. This permits him to select the dog-handler team
which will be most effective for each mission and gives the handler
enough time to prepare himself and his dog for the mission.
c. The scout dog may be employed in various ways.
(1) Reconnaissance patrols.
(a) Before reporting for patrol duty, the handler should
test the dog's alertness and readiness for work by lead-
ing him through a 15-minute period of basic obedience
exercises. If, for any reason, the dog is unsatisfactory
at duty time, another dog or another team should be
selected and used, even if the new dog has not re-
hearsed with the patrol.
(b) The dog and handler should be completely integrated
into the patrol during the planning, rehearsal, and
execution phases; and the handler must attend the de-
briefing phase. During the planning phase, the handler
makes recommendations to the patrol leader for the
employment of the dog. The patrol leader allows the
handler enough flexibility to work the dog in the most
effective manner.
(c) The presence of a scout dog in a patrol creates varied
reactions among personnel unfamiliar with scout dogs.
Some members of the patrol may feel an exaggerated
sense of security, while others may become apprehen-
sive. To avert these extreme reactions, the handler
should brief the patrol before rehearsals as to the dog's
mission and capabilities. Rehearsals enable the patrol
members to become familiar with the way the dog and
handler operate and also accustom the dog to the scents
of the individual patrol members and the noises and
actions of the patrol on the move.
(d) The dog and handler report to the assembly position at
least one hour before the patrol's scheduled time of de-
AGO 6344B 81

parture. This time leeway is necessary for final coordi-
nation, orientation of new patrol members as to the
dog and his capabilities, and for familiarizing the dog
with the scent of all patrol members.
(e) The dog and handler precede the patrol at a distance
which will permit immediate communication with the
patrol leader. At night, this distance may be an arm's
length; in daylight, the distance is greater, but within
easy visual signaling distance.
(f) The scout dog and handler move forward, keeping gen-
erally in the assigned direction, utilizing cover, and
moving so as best to take advantage of wind and other
conditions favoring the dog's sense of smell and hear-
ing. The patrol leader may from time to time change
the direction of the patrol's advance; in general, it is
advisable for the dog and handler to move at will for-
ward of the patrol.
(g) One member of the patrol should be assigned the mis-
sion of protecting the handler and dog. When a scout
dog is following a scent, the handler needs both' hands
and all his strength to control him. For this reason, the
handler shoud be armed with a .45 caliber pistol only.
(h) As soon as the dog warns of a hostile presence, the
handler passes the information to the patrol by signal-
ing "enemy in sight," whereupon the patrol leader at
once causes his patrol to take cover or halt. The patrol
leader goes quietly, taking advantage of all available
cover, to the scout dog and handler (fig. 33). The han-
dler briefs the patrol leader on what the team has
located. The patrol leader then takes the necessary
action. He may proceed in a new direction or circle
around the danger spot, preceded as before by the scout
dog and handler.
(i) A patrol accompanied by a dog and handler must be im-
pressed with the fact that all members must maintain
their usual patrol alertness and not rely solely on the
dog.
(2) Combat patrol.
(a) The working procedure for the handler-scout dog team
is the same as for a reconnaissance patrol except that
after the handler has given the patrol leader the definite
location of the enemy, the dog and handler immediately
retire to the rear or a flank position so as not to inter-
fere with any action undertaken by the patrol.
82 AGO 5344B

(b) If speed of movement is more essential than security,
the dog and handler may not be used at the point posi-
tion until relatively close to the objective. After the
patrol removes enemy opposition, it may continue its
mission, preceded as before by the scout dog and
handler.
(c) If the handler becomes a casualty and his dog will
permit him to be evacuated, this should be done. The
dog will follow his master. If the dog will not allow
anyone to assist the handler, the dog should be de-
stroyed.
(3) Outposts.
(a) In an outpost position, the main value of the scout dog
is to give timely warning of enemy approach or at-
tempts at infiltration of friendly lines. The dog and
handler are placed a short distance forward of the out-
post to which they are attached, within easy range of
visual signals in daylight, and even closer at night.
Figure 33. Scout dog on patrol.
AGO 65344B 83

(b) It is imperative to devise a communication system be-
tween the dog handler and the outpost commander. At
night a cord can be laid between the two positions and
the handler can give it a jerk to alert the outpost.
(c) After the dog detects an enemy and his handler notifies
the outpost, the dog and handler should withdraw to a
previously designated position or, if they are in a pre-
pared position, they should remain under cover, so they
will not be endangered by outpost and enemy fires.
(4) Night attacks. Scout dogs may be used to locate enemy
security elements during night attacks. They will nor-
mally be employed with the leading elements of the attack
and operate in the same manner as on a patrol. On com-
pleting its mission of detection, the dog-handler team
moves to a position of security.
104. Equipment for Scout Training
The handler will need a chain choke collar, a 5-foot and 25-foot
leash, and a scout harness. Leather collars and kennel chains may
be needed to tether dogs that are not working.
105. Basic Training Required
a. Before a dog starts scout training, he must be able to heel
closely, off leash, and respond independently to both oral commands
and command gestures for Down, Stay, Sit, Come, Jump, and
Crawl. He must also be accustomed to riding in vehicles and to
the sound of gunfire.
b. The handler must have a thorough working knowledge of
winds and scents and of his dog's working peculiarities.
106. Training Conditions
a. Functions of Handler. The handler must learn to read and
understand his dog so that he can interpret his every signal with
regard to the approach or presence of the enemy.
b. Functions of Assistant. The assistant acts as a decoy.
c. Location. Training starts in the regular training area. At
the beginning, the decoy should not always conceal himself behind
a screen such as a tree, rock, or bush. If, on the first three or four
scouting runs, the dog finds the decoy concealed behind some natu-
ral cover, he will associate such spots with his discovery of the
decoy and will consequently rely on his inferior eyesight to find
him. He will not use his nose and ears, which are the senses he
must learn to depend on. Training locations must be changed daily
84 AGO 5344B

so, that the dog does not learn to associate the decoy with a given
area.
d. Time. Although a scout dog is generally used at night, he
must be trained mostly during the daytime. The instructor decides
when a dog and handler have completed enough daytime training
and are ready for exercises at night.
107. Wind and Scent
a. General. The wind is probably the most important and, at the
same time, the most variable factor a handler has to contend with
in employing a scout dog to the best advantage. It is the wind that
carries the all-important human scent to the dog-or away from
him. A handler must therefore always be wind-conscious. He
should learn all he can about wind "habits," and he should be able
to feel or sense what direction the wind is blowing at any time with-
out having to rely on such expedients as dropping dust or a handful
of hair from his dog's back and noting its direction of drift. If a
handler keeps track of the wind and his dog gives an alert, he
knows that there is only one general direction to look for the enemy.
The only exception to this occurs when the dog gives a sight or
sound alert. Usually, a handler can distinguish this type of alert
from close familiarity with his dog's reactions, if not from his own
sense of sight or hearing.
b. Effects of Topography on Wind. Wind hitting a hilltop or
the crest of a hill is prone to break into two or three smaller
streams. A small table top mesa is probably the worst place for a
dog to try to find a hidden man. Scents borne by the wind off a
mesa may be scattered, blown aloft, or die before they come in
contact with ground level. A dog may pick up a scent far from a
mesa only to lose it once he comes close because it is being blown
over his head. Mountains, gorges, buttes, breaks, valleys, and
timberlines will all cause the wind to sweep and swirl. Thus, the
only wind that will blow with any steadiness is that which comes
over a flat and even surface.
c. Impermanence of Scent.
(1) Human scent dissipates more rapidly in a hot and dry
climate than it does in an area where there is quite a bit
of moisture. Heat from the sun causes scents to evaporate
rather rapidly. During rains, scents remain close to their
source.
(2) Human scents from foxholes become borne by the wind
because scents rise as they evaporate. These scents are
not as strong as those from men in the open.
AGO 5344B 85

(3) Dogs have a difficult time scenting in a grove or forest of
pine trees where there is always a carpet of pine needles
covering the ground.
108. Quartering
a. Quartering is the method the handler and his dog use to
search a piece of terrain, taking full advantage of the wind, to
locate any enemy that may be present. Scents borne by the wind
may be elusive. Sometimes the dog can detect them from one spot
whereas, from another spot just as close to the source of the scent,
he may receive no odor at all. Therefore, to give the dog every
opportunity to pick up an enemy scent, the handler must lead him
systematically over a fair-sized area so that every breeze can pass
through his nose.
b. Figure 34 shows a quartering course layout for training. The
instructor lays out the course and selects the starting point down-
wind from the decoy. The handler and dog proceed through the
course as diagrammed. Point A represents the spot where the dog
first alerts to a weak scent. The handler can then elect to further
quarter the course or let the dog follow the weak scent directly to
point B where the dog should give a strong alert. From this point,
the handler lets the dog move in and find the decoy.
c. Figure 35 shows schematically how a handler and dog would
quarter an area in the field to search out an enemy. At point A the
dog alerts. Based on his knowledge of the dog, the handler knows
that the alert at point A is a weak one. The team continues to
quarter, as shown, and the dog gives another weak alert at point B.
At point C the handler receives a strong alert and turns his dog in
the direction of the wind which is in the direction of the enemy.
109. Training Procedure
a. From the beginning of basic training, a dog selected for scout
training IS REPROVED IF HE ATTEMPTS TO BARK OR
WHINE. The handler must use every reasonable means to keep
him quiet. If the dog is taught to understand the correction "NO"
in basic training, it is usually not difficult to silence him with this
word. If necessary, his mouth may be held shut gently with the
hand. As soon as the dog is quiet or is content to growl very softly,
he should be patted and praised.
b. Before the dog and handler arrive in the training area, the
instructor visually selects a route for the team to follow. The in-
structor prepositions human decoys at various intervals and at
different distances away from and upwind to the prescribed route.

The instructor and decoys must not walk the selected route as their
odor will mark the trail.
c. The dog and his handler then enter the training area, which
is preferably one where high grass affords cover for the decoys.
Once in the field, the handler harnesses his dog and attaches the
5-foot leash. The dog wears the harness only when he is working.
The handler removes it at the conclusion of the exercise. On start-
ing the quartering exercise, the handler commands WATCH HIM,
letting the dog precede him on a loose leash. The dog will then
attempt to locate the decoy by smell, hearing, or sight. In this
initial exercise, it is important for the decoy to be well concealed
from view and remain quiet, but within easy scenting distance and
directly upwind from the dog.
88 AGO 5S44B

d. The dog is encouraged to lift his nose and sample the wind
well above ground level. When he detects a scent other than his
handler's, he is likely to react in one of the following ways:
(1) Tensing the whole body.
(2) Raising his hackles.
(3) Pricking up his ears.
(4) Giving other signs of alertness easily recognizable by a
keen observer, such as a desire to investigate, a slight
inclination to whimper or growl, an active or distinctly
rigid tail.
e. As soon as the dog gives evidence that he has picked up the
scent, the handler praises him. Praise at this point must be given
in a soft, almost whispering voice; it must not be insistent enough
to divert the dog from his work. (Some dogs when first going into
the field will put their noses to the ground and attempt to pick up a
ground scent. His handler must immediately discourage this tend-
ency by raising his foot under the dog's chin to make him lift his
head and reproving him with NO, NO in a stern'voice. It is impor-
tant that the dog's nose be raised to the proper scenting level
immediately if he attempts to ground trail.)
f. When the dog gives his alert, the handler deduces the general
direction to the decoy's hiding place and announces it to the in-
structor. If he is correct in his deduction, the instructor tells the
handler to follow the scent. When the dog is about 10 feet from
the decoy, the instructor tells the decoy to move out. The decoy
exppses himself and runs rapidly to his right. The handler allows
the dog to chase the decoy for 30 to 40 feet then turns off to his
left to avoid contact with the decoy. The handler rewards the dog
with praise and the exercise is considered concluded.
g. During repetitions of the exercise, the size of the quartering
course is enlarged and the number of decoys is increased. The dis-
tances between the dog and the concealed decoys are lengthened
progressively. The handler must give his dog every possible oppor-
tunity to locate the decoys. He stops at intervals so the dog can
take advantage of every breeze, quartering the field if necessary
for the dog to catch the scent. He pays strict attention to the dog's
action and encourages him as soon as he shows signs that he may
have spotted a decoy. The dog is not always allowed to follow the
scent to the decoy and give chase. The handler uses the chase as
a form of reward, but he should use it more and more infrequently
during training.
h. This exercise is repeated daily with the terrain and other
conditions being varied. The decoy is concealed in underbrush,
89
AGO 5344B

ditches, branches of a tree, behind rocks, or in any natural or
artificial hiding place.
i. The role of the decoy is played by a different man each day so
that the dog will learn that he must pick up all human scents other
than that of his handler.
j. After the dog and his handler have established mutual under-
standing, they practice the exercise at night.
110. Training for Outpost Duty
The procedure for training a dog for duty on an outpost as a
precaution against enemy infiltration differs from that described
in paragraph 109 in the following -respects. The dog remains
motionless and the decoy advances along a concealed route in day
practice. Less concealment is required for night practice. The
dog is trained to alert while stationary. The handler judges the
decoy's approach by the reaction of his dog.
111. Scout Dog Limitations
a. Smoke, fog, rain, and dust reduce the dog's effectiveness.
b. The dog becomes tired if he is used too often on patrol.
c. He is capable of error and may miss hostile troops or fail to
alert, especially in an area where there is much movement and
noise.
d. He needs retraining (basic and specialized) periodically and
the longer he goes without retraining the less efficient he will be.
e. He is subject to the elements the same as a human. When he
is extremely cold or overheated, he tends to be less alert.
f. If the dog is never given the opportunity to go in on a scent,
his effectiveness is reduced. In a combat situation, a training area
in the rear must be prepared so the dog can be given the oppor-
tunity to chase.
Section IV. THE SENTRY DOG
112. Use of Sentry Dogs
a. The sentry dog, as the name implies, is used principally on
interior guard duty as a watchdog. This type of dog is trained to
give warning to his handler by growling or barking, or by silent
alert. He is habitually worked on leash. The handler, keeping the
dog on leash, patrols his post and can depend on the dog to notify
him of the approach or presence of strangers in or about the area
being protected (fig. 36). When the dog alerts, the handler must
90 AGO 5344B

beprepared to cope with the situation as circumstances dictate;
that is, he must challenge; investigate, keeping carefully under
cover; or make an arrest. The dog, being kept on leash and close
to the handler, will also assist as a psychological factor in such
circumstances. He will attack on command of his handler.
b. The sentry dog can be used to advantage in such critical loca-
tions as-
Airplane dispersal areas Beach patrol areas
Gun emplacement areas Dynamite storage areas
Ammunition dumps Motor pools
Ration dumps Waterworks
Guided missile sites Warehouses
c. Where areas to be guarded are free from traffic, entirely con-
fined, and not excessively large, a trained dog may be turned loose
and permitted to roam at liberty. Only the dog's handler should
be permitted in or near the area being guarded and he must accom-
pany any patrol sent to a point in the area to check on the suspected
presence of trespassers so he can control the dog. Sentry dogs
working at liberty are usually sharp and will attack trespassers
at once.
d. The sentry dog is a one-man dog. Each dog is assigned to
only one handler for care, training, and duty.
e. Whenever practical, sentry dogs should patrol downwind from
the area being protected to increase their alerting range.
f. There is no need to withdraw sentry dog teams from post
during rainy weather. Although a heavy rain will tend to reduce
a dog's effective alerting range, his ability to detect intruders will
still exceed that of his handler. No difficulties should be encoun-
tered in the employment of sentry dogs in cold climates where tem-
peratures fall to 400 F. below zero. The dogs will adjust rapidly
to the extreme temperature; however, for peak efficiency in such
cold climates, carry out the following special instructions.
(1) Assign the dogs to their duty sites during the summer
months so they can gradually become acclimated before
cold weather sets in.
(2) Cold weather housing for dogs should be unheated and
located out-of-doors.
(3) In extremely cold climates, provide the dogs with boots to
protect their pads against ice cuts. Dog boots may be
made from canvas or leather as described in FM 25-6,
or they may be bought at appropriate civilian shops.
AGO 5344B 91

113. Selection for Training in Sentry Work
See paragraphs 98 and 99. To be suitable for sentry training,
dogs should possess the desirable traits (pars. 7-11) in the fol-
lowing degrees:
Intelligence: Moderate to high.
Willingness: Moderate to high.
Energy: Moderate to high.
Aggressiveness: High.
Sensitivity: Low to moderate.
114. Training Conditions
a. Functions of the Handler. In addition to teaching the dog to
obey his commands, the handler must instill in him the idea that
every human, except himself, is his natural enemy. He does this
by encouraging the dog to alert at the presence of any stranger and
to attempt to attack him. It must be emphasized that the handler
NEVER PERMITS ANYONE TO PET OR MAKE FRIENDS
WITH THE DOG HE IS TRAINING. He must remember that
he is the only friend the dog must recognize; he is the ONLY
master. For the same reason, the handler must never pet any dog
except his own.
b. Functions of Assistant. An assistant is used to act as agitator
and decoy. The agitator sharpens the dog's aggressiveness by
teasing and angering him and builds up his self-confidence by re-
treating as soon as the dog makes an aggressive move toward him.
He approaches the dog in a threatening manner, but when the dog
'~~~~~~.". .
Figure3 6. Sentry dog alerted.
92 AGO 5344B

makes the slightest move toward him, he retreats. His manner of
approaching the dog may be varied according to the dog's tempera-
ment. It is essential, however, that in every encounter between
the dog and the agitator, the DOG MUST ALWAYS BE THE
WINNER. The agitator is as important in sentry dog training as
the handler, and his work should be carefully supervised by the
instructor. For variety, different men are used as agitators. The
handler of one dog can act as agitator for the handler of another
dog. See paragraph 117 for the assistant's function when acting
as a decoy.
c. Location. Training starts in the regular training area. As the
dog progresses, he is moved to different locations, chosen to re-
semble various types of sentry posts.
d. Time. Initial training is done during daytime. When the dog
alerts consistently to the presence of unfamiliar persons in day-
light, final training is undertaken at night.
Figure3 7. Attack suit.
AGO 5344B 93

115. Equipment for Sentry Training
The following equipment is required:
a. The handler will need a chain choke collar, a 5-foot leather
leash, a 25-foot leash, a flat leather collar, a stake, and a kennel
chain.
b. The agitator needs a small flexible stick, rolled up sacking, or
other harmless weapon, and attack suit and extra sleeve (fig.
37).
116. Basic Training Required
The basic training requirements for sentry dogs are identical
to those for scout dogs (par. 105).
117. Training Procedure
a. Training for the sentry dog is divided into three stages.
(1) Testing, arousing, and controlling the dog's natural
aggressiveness. Some dogs are naturally aggressive and
do not need much teasing to become excited. To avoid
accidents, training in arousing aggressiveness may be
started by tying the dog to a stake with a kennel chain
attached to the broad leather collar. It is advisable to
loosen an inch or two of the earth around the stake so
that the stake will give a little when the dog lunges and
not check him too sharply.
(2) Teaching the dog to detect a stranger's presence or ap-
proach. The dog must learn to detect the presence of a
human in partial or complete concealment either below,
at, or above ground level. For this reason, the final stage
of sentry training must include patrols in areas where
decoys are concealed in such places as the branches of a
tree, behind a fence, or in a ditch. It is desirable to work
the dog on the 25-foot leash, as well as the short leash,
so that he can enter buildings and other suspected places
of concealment ahead of the handler.
(3) Teaching the dog to attack. The dog is taught to attack
on command and stop his attack on command. The com-
mand to attack is GET HIM and the command to release
or stop attacking is OUT. At the command GET HIM,
the handler drops the leash and the dog attacks. On the
command OUT, the dog returns to his handler who then
commands DOWN, STAY, and WATCH HIM.
94 AGO 5344B

b. Training proceeds as follows:
(1) When the dog is chained to a stake for agitation training
(a(1) above), the handler also puts a chain choke collar
on the dog with the 5-foot leather leash attached. The
handler heels the dog to the end of the chain, orders him
to sit, and steps away from the dog, keeping hold of the
leash.
(2) The handler puts the dog on the alert by the command
WATCH HIM uttered in a low voice, almost a whisper.
The command WATCH HIM is used only during early
training. It is a signal for the dog that he is on duty and
must be prepared to detect any intrusion. The command
should be eliminated as soon as the dog has learned that
putting on the collar and leash signifies that he is on duty.
WATCH HIM is never used in actual service to alert the
dog. The dog notifies the handler of danger, the handler
does not notify the dog.
(3) The agitator appears, equipped with a small, flexible stick
or some other harmless weapon. He approaches the dog
from an angle, not facing him directly. He looks at the
dog out of thecorner of his eyes; he does not stare at him.
He strikes at the dog without hitting him, and jumps
away. As he strikes, the handler encourages the dog by
saying GET HIM, GET HIM, in a sharp voice.
(4) Dogs will respond to this procedure according to their
natural aggressiveness. At this point, they may be con-
veniently classified as follows and their training con-
tinued accordingly:
(a) A moderately aggressive dog. This dog is the easiest
to train for sentry work. He barks or growls as soon
as the agitator appears, lunging on the chain and try-
ing to attack. The agitator runs away and out of sight.
As soon as the dog responds in this manner, the handler
praises him lavishly and, if the dog is not too excited,
steps close to him and pats him. When the handler is
convinced that the dog is aroused only against the
agitator and that he has no tendency to attack indis-
criminately, he may be considered ready for work off
the stake. The exercise for that day is concluded with
the agitator running away and the handler praising
the dog and unchaining him.
(b) An overaggressive dog. This dog is apt to ,lose his head,
try to bite everyone within reach, and keep on barking
even after the agitator disappears. In this case, the
AGO 5344B 95

handler scolds the dog. He shouts NO, NO, jerking on
the leash until the dog calms down. He must be careful
not to step within reach until the dog stops barking and
growling. When he is sure that the dog is calm enough,
he approaches him, speaking soothingly, and praises
and pets him. This procedure is repeated, except that
the agitator appears and disappears immediately. As
the dog shows signs of directing his aggressiveness
toward the agitator, the handler lavishes praise on him.
and tries to indicate to him that his hostility must be
directed only at the agitator. After two or three trials,
training stops for the day. It is resumed the following
day with the dog chained to the stake as before. He is
chained to the stake for this exercise until he has
demonstrated that he will not bite his handler, no mat-
ter how excited he becomes.
(c) An underaggressive dog. This dog reacts negatively
to the presence of the agitator. He may stand and wag
his tail, throw himself on the ground, or try to run
away from the agitator. In this case, the agitator ap-
proaches the dog from the flank and hits or seizes him
from behind. The handler sets an example for the dog
by making threatening gestures toward the agitator,
who imitates a dog's growl. When the dog, in trying
to protect himself, snaps or growls at the agitator, the
agitator at once stops teasing the dog and quickly steps
away. In training this type of dog, it is very important
for the handler to exaggerate his praise and encourage-
ment whenever the dog shows the slightest sign of
aggressiveness, and for the agitator to exaggerate his
simulated fear of the dog. This procedure must be re-
peated until the dog's confidence is built up and he tries
to attack the agitator as soon as he approaches. Train-
ing for the day is concluded with praise by the master
as the agitator disappears.
c. Six naturally aggressive dogs are brought out at the same
time. These are dogs which have demonstrated that they do not
need to be chained to the stake. Between every two of these dogs
is placed a dog that has reacted negatively to the first phase of
training. All the dogs are lined up far enough apart so that they
cannot get into a fight among themselves. Each dog is on leash at
the left side of his handler. At the command WATCH HIM, the
agitator appears and walks toward the dogs. Some of the dogs will
bark immediately; these should be praised lavishly by their han-
dlers. The agitator concentrates his attention on the dogs that do
96 AGO 5344B

not respond readily. He approaches them with his stick, threatens
them, and jumps away. Inspired by the bolder dogs beside them,
even the slow ones will eventually start barking. If properly en-
couraged by their masters, they will understand that there is
nothing to fear from the agitator, and that he will disappear as
soon as they bark, growl, or make a move toward him. When all
the dogs in the group alert as soon as the agitator appears, he must
vary his direction of approach and increase the distance at which
he first appears. The dogs that detect him earliest are praised
lavishly. It will be found that the slower dogs learn from their
aggressive companions, as well as from their handlers.
d. When all the dogs in the class alert at the approach of the
agitator, a new man takes his place. The dogs learn in this way
that ANY man approaching is an enemy. It is desirable to have
numerous persons play the role of the agitator.
e. The handler now plays the role of the sentry, walking post
with his dog heeling on loose leash. (This simulated post must be
changed each day so that the dog does not get accustomed to one
definite route.) When the dog and sentry have advanced a short
distance, the agitator approaches from some place of concealment.
If the dog has learned his first lessons, he will detect the approach
of the agitator and will alert without help from the handler. If he
does not alert, the handler gives him a cue by saying WATCH
HIM. As soon as the dog gives warning, the agitator runs out of
sight and the hander praises and encourages the dog. If the dog
does not respond correctly, the agitator conceals himself along the
dog's path of advance, steps out quickly from his hiding place, hits
at the dog with a stick, and jumps away. This will arouse the dog.
Furthermore, he will learn that unless he gives alarm immediately
upon detecting the presence of a stranger, he will suffer pain and
punishment.
f. When a dog detects and alerts to the presence of all strangers
at a considerable distance without any help during the daytime, he
is generally ready to be worked at night. It will usually be found
that a dog better at night because scenting conditions are more
favorable and his keen hearing is enhanced by the absence of
distracting noises.
118. Additional Training Notes
a. Importance of Loose Heeling. In walking a post, loose heel-
ing is essential as long as the dog does not pull or tug on the leash.
If a handler insists on close heeling, the dog is more likely to con-
centrate on perfection in heeling; this means that his attention
will be on the handler and not concentrated on his surroundings.
97
AGO 6344B

He is likely to forget his main duty, which is to be on the alert at
all times and ready to give alarm at the slightest provocation.
b. Importance of Distrust of Strangers. The sentry dog is
taught not to make friends with strangers. The handler walks his
dog on leash at the heel position. A stranger approaches uttering
soothing words and coaxes the dog to come to him. As soon as the
dog starts to respond with friendliness, the stranger slaps him
smartly on the nose and jumps away. The handler then encourages
the dog to attack the stranger. This is repeated with different
people acting as strangers until the dog growls and barks on the
approach of all strangers, no matter how friendly their attitude
or how much they attempt to appease the dog. Next, a stranger
tries to entice the dog with a piece of meat or any other bit of food
the dog likes particularly. If the dog tries to take the food, the
stranger slaps him on the nose and runs away without giving him
the food. Thus the dog learns that HIS HANDLER IS THE ONLY
PERSON TO BE TRUSTED.
Section V. ADVANCED OBEDIENCE AND AGITATION
TRAINING
119. Advanced Obedience
a. Advanced obedience training consists of requiring the dog to
run an obstacle course and to perform all exercises off leash and
without the use of command gestures. Since sentry dogs are nor-
mally used at night when gestures are useless, it is essential to
train them to understand and obey vocal commands. This advanced
training allows the handler to acquire increased control over his
dog and develops in the dog the discipline necessary for effective
military service.
b. At the start of obedience training, the dogs are well separated
to minimize the possibility of fights. A dog that attempts to attack
another should be muzzled immediately as punishment. As the
training progresses the handlers increase their control and the
dogs become accustomed to working together in the area. The
distance between dogs is then gradually reduced until handlers
and dog, working off leash, are capable of doing close order drill
and obedience exercises at intervals of four feet or less.
120. Obstacle Course
As in the case of human beings, sentry dogs cannot be expected
to maintain peak efficiency unless they are in top physical condi-
tion. This means that, in addition to receiving proper food and
98 AGO 5344B

medical care, they must be exercised frequently, regularly, and
strenuously. An obstacle course (fig. 38) which may be constructed
out of natural or salvage materials, provides an excellent medium
for such exercise. All units which have sentry dogs assigned should
have an obstacle course constructed. A good obstacle course should
include, but is not limited to, hurdles, ditches, and low ramps for
jumping; high ramps to teach the dog that wherever his handler
takes him he is not to be afraid; tunnels to teach a dog to crawl;
and walking logs or ladders raised above and parallel to the ground
to teach a dog to be more sure-footed.
121. Agitation
a. Advanced agitation training consists of teasing the dog to
the extent of making him bite at the agitator. The agitator wears
the extra sleeve (with or without the attack suit) to give the dog
something to actually bite. He uses a light switch or burlap bag
to irritate the dog. For the more dangerous exercises in agitation
training, the agitator may wear a fencer's face mask for added
protection (figs. 39, 40 and 42). This mask is not an item of issue,
but it is well worth the trouble to try to obtain one. The agitator
builds the dog up by acting frightened and backing up every time
the dog advances. Without exception, the dog must always be the
winner. A handler never agitates his own dog.
Note. Scout dogs are never given agitation training.
b. The dog always wears the leather collar for agitation train-
ing. As soon as a session has been completed the collar is removed.
In this way the dog soon comes to associate the leather collar with
agitation and when it is placed around his neck he will begin to
search for an agitator. He also wears the leather collar while per-
forming sentry duty. It is important that this leather collar/
agitator association be established early and firmly. The choke
chain is used only when taking a dog to or from the kennel area
and during obedience training.
c. It is agitation which develops in a dog the aggressiveness and
viciousness essential to an effective sentry dog. His aggressiveness
and viciousness determine his alertness on post and his urge to
attack. It is important to keep in mind that each dog is an indi-
vidual with a distinct temperament of his own and, to obtain the
best results, agitation must be suited to the dog. There are four
principal methods of agitation.
(1) Line agitation (fig. 39). Handlers and dogs form a single
line at intervals of about 30 feet, the dogs standing at
heel. The agitator quietly approaches one end of the line
from the rear. He stops when he is about 30 feet from
AGO 5344B 99

the first dog and handler and the instructor commands
ABOUT, FACE. All handlers and dogs execute about face,
and the first dog and handler advance slowly toward the
agitator. The handler incites his dog with the command
WATCH HIM. When the dog comes within 10 feet of
him, the agitator acts excited and afraid and begins to
retreat, walking backwards. The dog is allowed to ap-
proach within 3 feet of the agitator who then irritates
the dog a few moments with his switch, while continuing
to retreat. The handler then calls off his dog and leads
him back of the agitation line to the other end while the
next dog and handler start the same procedure. This
should continue until each dog has gone through three
repetitions of the agitation. The dogs are not allowed to
take hold of the agitator during this exercise.
(2) Circle agitation (fig. 40). Handlers and dogs form a
circle with a 30-foot interval between each team. The
agitator, wearing either an attack sleeve or an attack
suit and carrying a switch, takes his position in the center
Figure 38. Obstacle course.
Figure 39. Line agitation.
100 AGO 5344B

of the circle. At the command MOVE IN the handlers
and dogs move very slowly toward the agitator and the
handlers order the dogs to WATCH HIM. At the same
time, the handlers begin taking up the slack in the leashes
until, by the time the dogs are within four feet of the
agitator, the handlers are holding them by the leather

collar. This is necessary to protect the agitator and to
eliminate the possibility of one dog attacking another.
While the dogs are moving in, the agitator moves about
threatening first one dog and then another with his
switch. When the circle has been reduced to 10 feet in
diameter, the handlers halt and, at the instructor's com-
mand MOVE OUT, resume their original positions in the
large circle. This exercise is repeated several times. Next,
starting from the big circle, the agitator has the handlers
bring their dogs into the center of the circle one at a time
for individual agitation. In this phase of agitation, the
dogs are allowed to bite the agitator's attack sleeve or
suit. The aggressiveness shown by each dog stimulates
aggressiveness in the other dogs and creates an emotional
chain reaction. This is particularly effective in the case
of dogs that are deficient in aggressiveness or slow in
attacking or biting.
(3) Kennel agitation. This type agitation is used only on dogs
that do not respond to other types. The expected reaction
is based on the dog's natural instinct to protect his home.
The agitator approaches while the dog is in his run and
his handler is present. The agitator makes threatening
gestures and vocal sounds, slapping the fenced run with
a switch, burlap bag, or some other object (fig. 41). The
handler incites his dog against the agitator. At the first
sign of aggressiveness on the part of the dog, the agitator
runs away and is chased by the handler. The handler then
returns and praises and pets the dog. This should be re-
peated until the instructor determines that maximum
benefit has been realized.
(4) Stake agitation. Stake agitation follows kennel agitation.
It is conducted like kennel agitation except that the dog
is chained to a tree, post, or stake in some open space
away from the kennels. This exercise tends to further
build up the dog's confidence in himself in unfamiliar
places.
(5) Muzzle agitation. This is an exercise for sentry dogs. The
sentry dog is muzzled and allowed to attack his agitator
who wears regular clothing. This actually is a test to de-
termine if the dog will attack, on command, persons not
dressed in the attack suit. During training, many dogs
seem to acquire an almost exclusive association between
the attack suit and "enemy."
d. Dogs are never agitated from a vehicle. Eventually this will
AGO 5344B 103

cause them to look for and react against vehicles instead of people.
In addition, they become nervous and excited when vehicles ap-
proach, thus making it difficult to get them to enter one and ride
calmly.
e. Normally, dogs should be agitated at least three times weekly
to keep them at the peak of their effectiveness, but the tempera-
ment of individual dogs should also be considered in determining
the amount of agitation they need. Under no circumstances will a
dog be agitated in the absence of his handler.
122. Attack Training
The handler and his dog proceed to an area which is isolated
from both pedestrain and vehicular traffic. In the training area, the
handler puts the leather work collar on the dog and does not re-
move it until the exercise is completed. The agitator, dressed in
an attack suit, should be concealed upwind from the dog so that
his scent will be driven directly into the dog's nose. For the first
exercise in this phase of training, it is important for the agitator
to be well concealed, but within easy scenting distance and directly
upwind from the dog. The handler commands WATCH HIM, and
the dog then tries to locate the agitator by scent or sound. When
the dog alerts and pulls on the leash, the handler should put his
hand on the dog's flank, stroking it gently and whispering the
words, "Atta boy, Good boy," to praise the dog. He must praise
the dog enough to encourage him, but must not distract him from
his purpose. The dog's attention must remain focused in the direc-
tion of the agitator. The dog approaches the concealed agitator
and the handler again uses words of praise and encouragement.
When the dog gets to within a short distance of the agitator, the
agitator breaks cover. The handler orders the agitator to halt
and place his hands over his head. The agitator ignores the order
and tries to escape. The handler then releases his dog and com-
mands GET HIM. The dog then pursues and attacks the agitator
(fig. 42) who, after a brief struggle, ceases to resist. The handler
approaches, commands OUT, and draws the dog away from the
agitator, at the same time praising and patting him. He leads the
dog about 10 feet away from the agitator and commands DOWN,
STAY, and WATCH HIM. He then returns to the agitator and
searches him, being careful never to place himself between the
dog and the agitator. In the course of the search, the agitator
strikes or pushes the handler to the ground and tries to run away.
At this point the dog must attack the agitator WITHOUT COM-
MAND from the handler.

Figure 44. Escorting a prisoner.
123. Attacking Under Gunfire
Attack under gunfire is taught after the sentry dog is well
trained and the handler is sure that he will obey all commands or
gestures to attack and cease attack. The agitator wears the attack
suit. The procedure is like that prescribed in paragraph 122, ex-
cept that when the dog flushes the agitator, the handler and the
agitator exchange pistol shots, the handler firing first. The exer-
cise then continues through all the stages of pursuit, capture,
guard, and search. When exchanging shots, the handler and agita-
tor should be careful not to fire close to the dog's head to avoid
powder burns, particularly about his eyes and nose.
124. Guarding a Prisoner
On the command DOWN, the dog assumes this position behind
a motionless prisoner (fig. 43). He must not be close enough for
the prisoner to injure him with a sudden kick. The handler then
commands WATCH HIM to put the dog on the alert, and walks
106
AGO 5344B

away to a hiding place where he can observe the dog's actions.
The prisoner then starts to turn around, or walk or run away. If
the dog does not attack when the prisoner moves; the handler im-
mediately comes out of his hiding place and commands GET HIM.
This exercise is repeated until the dog pursues and attacks the
prisoner whenever he moves. The exercise should always conclude
with the handler returning to the scene, taking charge of the
prisoner, and praising the dog.
125. Escorting a Prisoner
The dog is taught that a prisoner is not to be attacked when
walking slowly, accompanied by the dog's handler. In this exercise;
the dog is made to heel on leash at the left side of the handler, while
a prisoner walks in front and slightly to the left of the dog (fig.
44). The prisoner suddenly turns in a threatening manner or
starts to run away. The handler drops the leash and the dog, if
well trained, will attack. At first, the handler may need to com-
mand GET HIM. The procedure is repeated until the dog attacks
without command when the prisoner makes any sudden break, but
refrains from attacking when the prisoner is marching in an
orderly manner ahead of the handler. The handler praises his dog
at the conclusion of each exercise.
AGO 5344B 107

CHAPTER 5
HINTS FOR HANDLERS
126. Helpful Hints
a. Oral commands should always be given with the same words,
in the same tone, and at the same rate of speed.
b. Do not punish your dog for failure to execute a command
unless you are certain that he understands what you want.
c. Reward follows promptly after each act done properly;
punishment follows every act of disobedience.
d. To punish a dog at any time other than instantly after he has
committed a wrong act is cruelty rather than training.
e. Training periods should not be too long as a dog tires quickly
and will go sour on the lesson.
f. If a dog does one step wrong, do not repeat this step only.
Begin again, for a dog must learn acts in their entirety to carry
them out successfully.
g. Never fool your dog, he has a sense of humiliation and pride.
He is to always understand that when you say a certain word, a
certain thing will happen. There must never be a break in this
seeming cause and effect.
h. Anticipate your dog's actions. Think ahead of him.
i. Do not lose your temper while training your dog. He will lose
respect for you. A person must refrain from venting his anger
on an animal.
j. Have patience with your dog. He wants to do what you want
him to do, but you cannot tell him in a language that he readily
understands.
k. All dog training is founded on the theory that his natural
instincts and abilities can be stimulated and developed.
1. A dog has a one-track mind. Teach him only one thing at a
time.
m. Too many masters, too many friends, too many strangers will
ruin your dog. Let him know only one master: You, whose word
is supreme law.

(1) Rub against the grain using the fingertips.
(2) Rub with the grain using fingertips.
(3) Brush against the grain.
(4) Brush with the grain.
(5) Comb only to remove dead hair.
(6) Smooth hair down with hand.
129. Jerk on the Leash
A jerk on the leash is a very necessary thing, especially in the
basic training of your dog. It will mildly discipline an otherwise
errant dog and is effective in getting the attention of young and
AGO 5344B 109

inattentive dogs, indicating to them that some new move or com-
mand is coming up. The handler should never jerk the leash
violently enough to injure the dog, nor viciously to vent his temper
on the dog.
130. Reminders for Dog Handler Going on Patrol
a. If possible, accompany the patrol leader on his ground recon-
naissance and assist him in making the detailed plans for the patrol
(such as suggesting a route that will allow the dog to work at
maximum efficiency).
b. If it is to be a long patrol, make sure that food and water are
provided for the dog.
c. Inform the patrol members of the temperament of the par-
ticular dog to be used on the patrol.
d. Inform the patrol what should be done in regard to the dog
if you are seriously wounded or killed.
e. Establish with the patrol leader a system of signals to use for
exchanging information once your dog detects the presence of the
enemy.
f. Inspect your dog's working equipment to see that all metal
parts are taped or wrapped to preclude unnecessary noise. This
inspection includes the metal choke chain, the snap on the leash,
and the D-ring of the leather harness.
g. Walk your dog at heel and review him in basic obedience for
about 15 minutes just before you take him to join the patrol. This
gives the dog an opportunity to evacuate and to burn up some of
his accumulated nervous energy.
